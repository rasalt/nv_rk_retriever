The Benefits of Using GPUs\\n\\nThe Graphics Processing Unit (GPU)6 provides much higher instruction throughput andmemory band-\\nwidth than the CPUwithin a similar price and power envelope. Many applications leverage these higher\\ncapabilities to run faster on the GPU than on the CPU (see GPU Applications). Other computing de-\\nvices, like FPGAs, are also very energy efficient, but offermuch less programming flexibility than GPUs.\\n\\nThis difference in capabilities between the GPU and the CPU exists because they are designed with\\ndifferent goals in mind. While the CPU is designed to excel at executing a sequence of operations,\\ncalled a thread, as fast as possible and can execute a few tens of these threads in parallel, the GPU\\nis designed to excel at executing thousands of them in parallel (amortizing the slower single-thread\\nperformance to achieve greater throughput).\\n\\nThe GPU is specialized for highly parallel computations and therefore designed such thatmore transis-\\ntors are devoted to data processing rather than data caching and flow control. The schematic Figure\\n1 shows an example distribution of chip resources for a CPU versus a GPU.\\n\\nFigure 1: The GPU Devotes More Transistors to Data Processing\\n\\nDevoting more transistors to data processing, for example, floating-point computations, is beneficial\\nfor highly parallel computations; the GPU can hidememory access latencies with computation, instead\\n\\n6 The graphics qualifier comes from the fact that when the GPU was originally created, two decades ago, it was designed as\\na specialized processor to accelerate graphics rendering. Driven by the insatiable market demand for real-time, high-definition,\\n3D graphics, it has evolved into a general processor used for many more workloads than just graphics rendering.\\n\\n3\\n\\nhttps://www.nvidia.com/object/gpu-applications.html\\nindex.html#from-graphics-processing-to-general-purpose-parallel-computing-gpu-devotes-more-transistors-to-data-processing\\nindex.html#from-graphics-processing-to-general-purpose-parallel-computing-gpu-devotes-more-transistors-to-data-processing\\n\\n\\nCUDA C++ Programming Guide, Release 12.4\\n\\nof relying on large data caches and complex flow control to avoid long memory access latencies, both\\nof which are expensive in terms of transistors.\\n\\nIn general, an application has amix of parallel parts and sequential parts, so systems are designedwith\\na mix of GPUs and CPUs in order to maximize overall performance. Applications with a high degree of\\nparallelism can exploit this massively parallel nature of the GPU to achieve higher performance than\\non the CPU.\\n\\n4 Chapter 1.

CUDA®: A General-Purpose\\nParallel Computing Platform\\nand Programming Model\\n\\nIn November 2006, NVIDIA® introduced CUDA®, a general purpose parallel computing platform and\\nprogrammingmodel that leverages the parallel compute engine in NVIDIAGPUs to solvemany complex\\ncomputational problems in a more efficient way than on a CPU.\\n\\nCUDA comes with a software environment that allows developers to use C++ as a high-level program-\\nming language. As illustrated by Figure 2, other languages, application programming interfaces, or\\ndirectives-based approaches are supported, such as FORTRAN, DirectCompute, OpenACC.\\n\\n5\\n\\nindex.html#cuda-general-purpose-parallel-computing-architecture-cuda-is-designed-to-support-various-languages-and-application-programming-interfaces\\n\\n\\nCUDA C++ Programming Guide, Release 12.4\\n\\nFigure 2: GPUComputingApplications. CUDA is designed to support various languages and application\\nprogramming interfaces.\\n\\n6 Chapter 2. CUDA®: A General-Purpose Parallel Computing Platform and Programming Model\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 3. A Scalable Programming\\nModel\\n\\nThe advent of multicore CPUs and manycore GPUs means that mainstream processor chips are now\\nparallel systems. The challenge is to develop application software that transparently scales its paral-\\nlelism to leverage the increasing number of processor cores, much as 3D graphics applications trans-\\nparently scale their parallelism to manycore GPUs with widely varying numbers of cores.\\n\\nThe CUDA parallel programming model is designed to overcome this challenge while maintaining a low\\nlearning curve for programmers familiar with standard programming languages such as C.\\n\\nAt its core are three key abstractions — a hierarchy of thread groups, shared memories, and barrier\\nsynchronization— that are simply exposed to the programmer as aminimal set of language extensions.\\n\\nThese abstractions provide fine-grained data parallelism and thread parallelism, nested within coarse-\\ngrained data parallelism and task parallelism. They guide the programmer to partition the problem\\ninto coarse sub-problems that can be solved independently in parallel by blocks of threads, and each\\nsub-problem into finer pieces that can be solved cooperatively in parallel by all threadswithin the block.\\n\\nThis decomposition preserves language expressivity by allowing threads to cooperate when solving\\neach sub-problem, and at the same time enables automatic scalability. Indeed, each block of threads\\ncan be scheduled on any of the available multiprocessors within a GPU, in any order, concurrently or\\nsequentially, so that a compiled CUDA program can execute on any number of multiprocessors as\\nillustrated by Figure 3, and only the runtime system needs to know the physical multiprocessor count.\\n\\nThis scalable programming model allows the GPU architecture to span a wide market range by simply\\nscaling the number ofmultiprocessors andmemory partitions: from the high-performance enthusiast\\nGeForce GPUs and professional Quadro and Tesla computing products to a variety of inexpensive,\\nmainstream GeForce GPUs (see CUDA-Enabled GPUs for a list of all CUDA-enabled GPUs).\\n\\n7\\n\\nindex.html#scalable-programming-model-automatic-scalability\\nindex.html#cuda-enabled-gpus\\n\\n\\nCUDA C++ Programming Guide, Release 12.4\\n\\nFigure 3: Automatic Scalability\\n\\nNote: A GPU is built around an array of Streaming Multiprocessors (SMs) (see Hardware Implementation for\\nmore details). A multithreaded program is partitioned into blocks of threads that execute independently from\\neach other, so that a GPU with more multiprocessors will automatically execute the program in less time than a\\n\\nGPU with fewer multiprocessors.\\n\\n8 Chapter 3.

Document Structure\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 5. Programming Model\\n\\nThis chapter introduces the main concepts behind the CUDA programming model by outlining how\\nthey are exposed in C++.\\n\\nAn extensive description of CUDA C++ is given in Programming Interface.\\n\\nFull code for the vector addition example used in this chapter and the next can be found in the vec-\\ntorAdd CUDA sample.\\n\\n5.1. Kernels\\n\\nCUDAC++ extends C++ by allowing the programmer to define C++ functions, called kernels, that, when\\ncalled, are executedN times in parallel by N differentCUDA threads, as opposed to only once like regular\\nC++ functions.\\n\\nA kernel is defined using the __global__ declaration specifier and the number of CUDA threads that\\nexecute that kernel for a given kernel call is specified using a new <<<...>>>execution configuration\\nsyntax (see C++ Language Extensions). Each thread that executes the kernel is given a unique thread\\nID that is accessible within the kernel through built-in variables.\\n\\nAs an illustration, the following sample code, using the built-in variable threadIdx, adds two vectors\\nA and B of size N and stores the result into vector C:\\n\\n∕∕ Kernel definition\\n__global__ void VecAdd(float* A, float* B, float* C)\\n{\\n\\nint i = threadIdx.x;\\nC[i] = A[i] + B[i];\\n\\n}\\n\\nint main()\\n{\\n\\n...\\n∕∕ Kernel invocation with N threads\\nVecAdd<<<1, N>>>(A, B, C);\\n...\\n\\n}\\n\\nHere, each of the N threads that execute VecAdd() performs one pair-wise addition.\\n\\n11\\n\\nindex.html#programming-interface\\nhttps://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-samples/index.html#vector-addition\\nhttps://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-samples/index.html#vector-addition\\nindex.html#c-language-extensions\\n\\n\\nCUDA C++ Programming Guide, Release 12.4\\n\\n5.2. Thread Hierarchy\\n\\nFor convenience, threadIdx is a 3-component vector, so that threads can be identified using a one-\\ndimensional, two-dimensional, or three-dimensional thread index, forming a one-dimensional, two-\\ndimensional, or three-dimensional block of threads, called a thread block. This provides a natural way\\nto invoke computation across the elements in a domain such as a vector, matrix, or volume.\\n\\nThe index of a thread and its thread ID relate to each other in a straightforward way: For a one-\\ndimensional block, they are the same; for a two-dimensional block of size (Dx, Dy), the thread ID of\\na thread of index (x, y) is (x + y Dx); for a three-dimensional block of size (Dx, Dy, Dz), the thread ID of a\\nthread of index (x, y, z) is (x + y Dx + z Dx Dy).\\n\\nAs an example, the following code adds two matrices A and B of size NxN and stores the result into\\nmatrix C:\\n\\n∕∕ Kernel definition\\n__global__ void MatAdd(float A[N][N], float B[N][N],\\n\\nfloat C[N][N])\\n{\\n\\nint i = threadIdx.x;\\nint j = threadIdx.y;\\nC[i][j] = A[i][j] + B[i][j];\\n\\n}\\n\\nint main()\\n{\\n\\n...\\n∕∕ Kernel invocation with one block of N * N * 1 threads\\nint numBlocks = 1;\\ndim3 threadsPerBlock(N, N);\\nMatAdd<<<numBlocks, threadsPerBlock>>>(A, B, C);\\n...\\n\\n}\\n\\nThere is a limit to the number of threads per block, since all threads of a block are expected to reside\\non the same streaming multiprocessor core and must share the limited memory resources of that\\ncore. On current GPUs, a thread block may contain up to 1024 threads.\\n\\nHowever, a kernel can be executed by multiple equally-shaped thread blocks, so that the total number\\nof threads is equal to the number of threads per block times the number of blocks.\\n\\nBlocks are organized into a one-dimensional, two-dimensional, or three-dimensional grid of thread\\nblocks as illustrated by Figure 4. The number of thread blocks in a grid is usually dictated by the size\\nof the data being processed, which typically exceeds the number of processors in the system.\\n\\nThe number of threads per block and the number of blocks per grid specified in the <<<...>>> syntax\\ncan be of type int or dim3. Two-dimensional blocks or grids can be specified as in the example above.\\n\\nEach block within the grid can be identified by a one-dimensional, two-dimensional, or three-\\ndimensional unique index accessible within the kernel through the built-in blockIdx variable. The\\ndimension of the thread block is accessible within the kernel through the built-in blockDim variable.\\n\\nExtending the previous MatAdd() example to handle multiple blocks, the code becomes as follows.\\n\\n∕∕ Kernel definition\\n__global__ void MatAdd(float A[N][N], float B[N][N],\\nfloat C[N][N])\\n\\n(continues on next page)\\n\\n12 Chapter 5.

The\\ngrid is created with enough blocks to have one thread per matrix element as before. For simplicity,\\nthis example assumes that the number of threads per grid in each dimension is evenly divisible by the\\nnumber of threads per block in that dimension, although that need not be the case.\\n\\nThread blocks are required to execute independently: It must be possible to execute them in any order,\\nin parallel or in series. This independence requirement allows threadblocks to be scheduled in any order\\nacross any number of cores as illustrated by Figure 3, enabling programmers to write code that scales\\nwith the number of cores.\\n\\nThreadswithin a block can cooperate by sharing data through some sharedmemory and by synchroniz-\\ning their execution to coordinate memory accesses. More precisely, one can specify synchronization\\npoints in the kernel by calling the __syncthreads() intrinsic function; __syncthreads() acts as a\\nbarrier at which all threads in the block must wait before any is allowed to proceed. Shared Memory\\ngives an example of using shared memory. In addition to __syncthreads(), the Cooperative Groups\\nAPI provides a rich set of thread-synchronization primitives.\\n\\nFor efficient cooperation, the shared memory is expected to be a low-latency memory near each pro-\\ncessor core (much like an L1 cache) and __syncthreads() is expected to be lightweight.\\n\\n5.2.

Thread Block Clusters\\n\\nWith the introduction of NVIDIA Compute Capability 9.0, the CUDA programming model introduces\\nan optional level of hierarchy called Thread Block Clusters that are made up of thread blocks. Similar\\nto how threads in a thread block are guaranteed to be co-scheduled on a streaming multiprocessor,\\nthread blocks in a cluster are also guaranteed to be co-scheduled on a GPU Processing Cluster (GPC)\\nin the GPU.\\n\\nSimilar to thread blocks, clusters are also organized into a one-dimension, two-dimension, or three-\\ndimension as illustrated by Figure 5. The number of thread blocks in a cluster can be user-defined, and\\namaximum of 8 thread blocks in a cluster is supported as a portable cluster size in CUDA. Note that on\\nGPU hardware or MIG configurations which are too small to support 8 multiprocessors the maximum\\ncluster size will be reduced accordingly. Identification of these smaller configurations, as well as of\\nlarger configurations supporting a thread block cluster size beyond 8, is architecture-specific and can\\nbe queried using the cudaOccupancyMaxPotentialClusterSize API.\\n\\nFigure 5: Grid of Thread Block Clusters\\n\\nNote: In a kernel launched using cluster support, the gridDim variable still denotes the size in terms\\nof number of thread blocks, for compatibility purposes. The rank of a block in a cluster can be found\\nusing the Cluster Group API.\\n\\nA thread block cluster can be enabled in a kernel either using a compiler time kernel attribute using\\n__cluster_dims__(X,Y,Z) or using the CUDA kernel launch API cudaLaunchKernelEx. The exam-\\nple below shows how to launch a cluster using compiler time kernel attribute. The cluster size using\\nkernel attribute is fixed at compile time and then the kernel can be launched using the classical <<<\\n, >>>.

The rank of a thread or block in\\nthe cluster group can be queried using dim_threads() and dim_blocks() API respectively.\\n\\nThread blocks that belong to a cluster have access to the Distributed Shared Memory. Thread blocks\\n\\n5.2.

Distributed SharedMemory gives an example of performing histograms in distributed shared\\nmemory.\\n\\n5.3. Memory Hierarchy\\n\\nCUDA threads may access data from multiple memory spaces during their execution as illustrated by\\nFigure 6. Each thread has private local memory. Each thread block has shared memory visible to all\\nthreads of the block and with the same lifetime as the block. Thread blocks in a thread block cluster\\ncan perform read, write, and atomics operations on each other’s shared memory. All threads have\\naccess to the same global memory.\\n\\nThere are also two additional read-only memory spaces accessible by all threads: the constant and\\ntexture memory spaces. The global, constant, and texture memory spaces are optimized for differ-\\nent memory usages (see Device Memory Accesses). Texture memory also offers different addressing\\nmodes, as well as data filtering, for some specific data formats (see Texture and Surface Memory).\\n\\nThe global, constant, and texture memory spaces are persistent across kernel launches by the same\\napplication.\\n\\nFigure 6: Memory Hierarchy\\n\\n16 Chapter 5.

Heterogeneous Programming\\n\\nAs illustrated by Figure 7, the CUDA programming model assumes that the CUDA threads execute on\\na physically separate device that operates as a coprocessor to the host running the C++ program. This\\nis the case, for example, when the kernels execute on a GPU and the rest of the C++ program executes\\non a CPU.\\n\\nTheCUDAprogrammingmodel also assumes that both the host and the devicemaintain their own sep-\\naratememory spaces in DRAM, referred to as hostmemory and devicememory, respectively. Therefore,\\na program manages the global, constant, and texture memory spaces visible to kernels through calls\\nto the CUDA runtime (described in Programming Interface). This includes device memory allocation\\nand deallocation as well as data transfer between host and device memory.\\n\\nUnified Memory provides managed memory to bridge the host and device memory spaces. Managed\\nmemory is accessible from all CPUs and GPUs in the system as a single, coherent memory image with\\na common address space. This capability enables oversubscription of device memory and can greatly\\nsimplify the task of porting applications by eliminating the need to explicitly mirror data on host and\\ndevice. See Unified Memory Programming for an introduction to Unified Memory.\\n\\n5.5. Asynchronous SIMT Programming Model\\n\\nIn the CUDA programmingmodel a thread is the lowest level of abstraction for doing a computation or\\na memory operation. Starting with devices based on the NVIDIA Ampere GPU architecture, the CUDA\\nprogramming model provides acceleration to memory operations via the asynchronous programming\\nmodel. The asynchronous programming model defines the behavior of asynchronous operations with\\nrespect to CUDA threads.\\n\\nThe asynchronous programmingmodel defines the behavior of Asynchronous Barrier for synchroniza-\\ntion between CUDA threads. The model also explains and defines how cuda::memcpy_async can be\\nused to move data asynchronously from global memory while computing in the GPU.\\n\\n5.5.1. Asynchronous Operations\\n\\nAn asynchronous operation is defined as an operation that is initiated by a CUDA thread and is exe-\\ncuted asynchronously as-if by another thread. In a well formed program one or more CUDA threads\\nsynchronize with the asynchronous operation. The CUDA thread that initiated the asynchronous op-\\neration is not required to be among the synchronizing threads.\\n\\nSuch an asynchronous thread (an as-if thread) is always associated with the CUDA thread that ini-\\ntiated the asynchronous operation. An asynchronous operation uses a synchronization object to\\nsynchronize the completion of the operation. Such a synchronization object can be explicitly man-\\naged by a user (e.g., cuda::memcpy_async) or implicitly managed within a library (e.g., coopera-\\ntive_groups::memcpy_async).\\n\\nA synchronization object could be a cuda::barrier or a cuda::pipeline. These objects are ex-\\nplained in detail in Asynchronous Barrier and Asynchronous Data Copies using cuda::pipeline. These\\nsynchronization objects can be used at different thread scopes. A scope defines the set of threads\\nthat may use the synchronization object to synchronize with the asynchronous operation. The follow-\\ning table defines the thread scopes available in CUDA C++ and the threads that can be synchronized\\nwith each.\\n\\n5.4.

Compute Capability\\n\\nThe compute capability of a device is represented by a version number, also sometimes called its “SM\\nversion”. This version number identifies the features supported by the GPU hardware and is used by\\napplications at runtime to determine which hardware features and/or instructions are available on the\\npresent GPU.\\n\\nThe compute capability comprises a major revision number X and a minor revision number Y and is\\ndenoted by X.Y.\\n\\nDevices with the same major revision number are of the same core architecture. The major revision\\nnumber is 9 for devices based on the NVIDIA Hopper GPU architecture, 8 for devices based on the\\nNVIDIA Ampere GPU architecture, 7 for devices based on the Volta architecture, 6 for devices based on\\nthe Pascal architecture, 5 for devices based on the Maxwell architecture, and 3 for devices based on\\nthe Kepler architecture.\\n\\nThe minor revision number corresponds to an incremental improvement to the core architecture, pos-\\nsibly including new features.\\n\\nTuring is the architecture for devices of compute capability 7.5, and is an incremental update based\\non the Volta architecture.\\n\\nCUDA-Enabled GPUs lists of all CUDA-enabled devices along with their compute capability. Compute\\nCapabilities gives the technical specifications of each compute capability.\\n\\nNote: The compute capability version of a particular GPU should not be confused with the CUDA\\nversion (for example, CUDA 7.5, CUDA 8, CUDA 9), which is the version of the CUDA software platform.\\nThe CUDA platform is used by application developers to create applications that run on many genera-\\ntions of GPU architectures, including future GPU architectures yet to be invented. While new versions\\n\\n5.6.

Programming Model\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 6. Programming Interface\\n\\nCUDAC++ provides a simple path for users familiar with the C++ programming language to easily write\\nprograms for execution by the device.\\n\\nIt consists of a minimal set of extensions to the C++ language and a runtime library.\\n\\nThe core language extensions have been introduced in Programming Model. They allow programmers\\nto define a kernel as a C++ function and use some new syntax to specify the grid and block dimension\\neach time the function is called. A complete description of all extensions can be found in C++ Language\\nExtensions. Any source file that contains some of these extensions must be compiled with nvcc as\\noutlined in Compilation with NVCC.\\n\\nThe runtime is introduced in CUDA Runtime. It provides C and C++ functions that execute on the host\\nto allocate and deallocate device memory, transfer data between host memory and device memory,\\nmanage systems with multiple devices, etc. A complete description of the runtime can be found in\\nthe CUDA reference manual.\\n\\nThe runtime is built on top of a lower-level C API, the CUDA driver API, which is also accessible by the\\napplication. The driver API provides an additional level of control by exposing lower-level concepts such\\nas CUDA contexts - the analogue of host processes for the device - and CUDAmodules - the analogue\\nof dynamically loaded libraries for the device. Most applications do not use the driver API as they do\\nnot need this additional level of control and when using the runtime, context andmodulemanagement\\nare implicit, resulting in more concise code. As the runtime is interoperable with the driver API, most\\napplications that need some driver API features can default to use the runtime API and only use the\\ndriver API where needed. The driver API is introduced in Driver API and fully described in the reference\\nmanual.\\n\\n6.1. Compilation with NVCC\\n\\nKernels can be written using the CUDA instruction set architecture, called PTX, which is described\\nin the PTX reference manual. It is however usually more effective to use a high-level programming\\nlanguage such as C++. In both cases, kernels must be compiled into binary code by nvcc to execute\\non the device.\\n\\nnvcc is a compiler driver that simplifies the process of compiling C++ or PTX code: It provides simple\\nand familiar command line options and executes them by invoking the collection of tools that imple-\\nment the different compilation stages. This section gives an overview of nvccworkflow and command\\noptions. A complete description can be found in the nvcc user manual.\\n\\n21\\n\\nindex.html#programming-model\\nindex.html#c-language-extensions\\nindex.html#c-language-extensions\\nindex.html#compilation-with-nvcc\\nindex.html#cuda-c-runtime\\nindex.html#driver-api\\n\\n\\nCUDA C++ Programming Guide, Release 12.4\\n\\n6.1.1. Compilation Workflow\\n\\n6.1.1.1 Offline Compilation\\n\\nSource files compiled with nvcc can include a mix of host code (i.e., code that executes on the host)\\nand device code (i.e., code that executes on the device). nvcc’s basic workflow consists in separating\\ndevice code from host code and then:\\n\\n▶ compiling the device code into an assembly form (PTX code) and/or binary form (cubin object),\\n\\n▶ and modifying the host code by replacing the <<<...>>> syntax introduced in Kernels (and de-\\nscribed inmore details in Execution Configuration) by the necessary CUDA runtime function calls\\nto load and launch each compiled kernel from the PTX code and/or cubin object.\\n\\nThe modified host code is output either as C++ code that is left to be compiled using another tool or\\nas object code directly by letting nvcc invoke the host compiler during the last compilation stage.\\n\\nApplications can then:\\n\\n▶ Either link to the compiled host code (this is the most common case),\\n\\n▶ Or ignore the modified host code (if any) and use the CUDA driver API (see Driver API) to load and\\nexecute the PTX code or cubin object.\\n\\n6.1.1.2 Just-in-Time Compilation\\n\\nAny PTX code loaded by an application at runtime is compiled further to binary code by the device\\ndriver. This is called just-in-time compilation. Just-in-time compilation increases application load time,\\nbut allows the application to benefit from any new compiler improvements coming with each new\\ndevice driver. It is also the only way for applications to run on devices that did not exist at the time the\\napplication was compiled, as detailed in Application Compatibility.\\n\\nWhen the device driver just-in-time compiles some PTX code for some application, it automatically\\ncaches a copy of the generated binary code in order to avoid repeating the compilation in subsequent\\ninvocations of the application. The cache - referred to as compute cache - is automatically invalidated\\nwhen the device driver is upgraded, so that applications can benefit from the improvements in the\\nnew just-in-time compiler built into the device driver.\\n\\nEnvironment variables are available to control just-in-time compilation as described in CUDA Environ-\\nment Variables\\n\\nAs an alternative to using nvcc to compile CUDA C++ device code, NVRTC can be used to compile\\nCUDA C++ device code to PTX at runtime. NVRTC is a runtime compilation library for CUDA C++; more\\ninformation can be found in the NVRTC User guide.\\n\\n6.1.2. Binary Compatibility\\n\\nBinary code is architecture-specific. A cubin object is generated using the compiler option -code that\\nspecifies the targeted architecture: For example, compiling with -code=sm_80 produces binary code\\nfor devices of compute capability 8.0. Binary compatibility is guaranteed from one minor revision to\\nthe next one, but not from one minor revision to the previous one or across major revisions. In other\\nwords, a cubin object generated for compute capability X.y will only execute on devices of compute\\ncapability X.z where z�y.\\n\\n22 Chapter 6.

It is not supported for Tegra. Also, the\\nbinary compatibility between desktop and Tegra is not supported.\\n\\n6.1.3. PTX Compatibility\\n\\nSome PTX instructions are only supported on devices of higher compute capabilities. For example,\\nWarp Shuffle Functions are only supported on devices of compute capability 5.0 and above. The -arch\\ncompiler option specifies the compute capability that is assumedwhen compiling C++ to PTX code. So,\\ncode that contains warp shuffle, for example, must be compiled with -arch=compute_50 (or higher).\\n\\nPTX code produced for some specific compute capability can always be compiled to binary code of\\ngreater or equal compute capability. Note that a binary compiled from an earlier PTX version may not\\nmake use of some hardware features. For example, a binary targeting devices of compute capability\\n7.0 (Volta) compiled fromPTX generated for compute capability 6.0 (Pascal) will notmake use of Tensor\\nCore instructions, since these were not available on Pascal. As a result, the final binary may perform\\nworse than would be possible if the binary were generated using the latest version of PTX.\\n\\nPTX code compiled to target architecture conditional features only run on the exact same physical\\narchitecture and nowhere else. Arch conditional PTX code is not forward and backward compatible.\\nExample code compiled with sm_90a or compute_90a only runs on devices with compute capability\\n9.0 and is not backward or forward compatible.\\n\\n6.1.4. Application Compatibility\\n\\nTo execute code on devices of specific compute capability, an application must load binary or PTX\\ncode that is compatible with this compute capability as described in Binary Compatibility and PTX\\nCompatibility. In particular, to be able to execute code on future architectures with higher compute\\ncapability (for which no binary code can be generated yet), an application must load PTX code that will\\nbe just-in-time compiled for these devices (see Just-in-Time Compilation).\\n\\nWhich PTX and binary code gets embedded in a CUDA C++ application is controlled by the -arch and\\n-code compiler options or the -gencode compiler option as detailed in the nvcc user manual. For\\nexample,\\n\\nnvcc x.cu\\n-gencode arch=compute_50,code=sm_50\\n-gencode arch=compute_60,code=sm_60\\n-gencode arch=compute_70,code=\\\\\"compute_70,sm_70\\\\\"\\n\\nembeds binary code compatible with compute capability 5.0 and 6.0 (first and second -gencode op-\\ntions) and PTX and binary code compatible with compute capability 7.0 (third -gencode option).\\n\\nHost code is generated to automatically select at runtime the most appropriate code to load and\\nexecute, which, in the above example, will be:\\n\\n▶ 5.0 binary code for devices with compute capability 5.0 and 5.2,\\n\\n▶ 6.0 binary code for devices with compute capability 6.0 and 6.1,\\n\\n▶ 7.0 binary code for devices with compute capability 7.0 and 7.5,\\n\\n6.1.

The __CUDA_ARCH__ macro can be\\nused to differentiate various code paths based on compute capability. It is only defined for device\\ncode. When compiling with -arch=compute_80 for example, __CUDA_ARCH__ is equal to 800.\\n\\nIf x.cu is compiled for architecture conditional features example with sm_90a or compute_90a, the\\ncode can only run on devices with compute capability 9.0.\\n\\nApplications using the driver API must compile code to separate files and explicitly load and execute\\nthe most appropriate file at runtime.\\n\\nThe Volta architecture introduces Independent Thread Scheduling which changes the way threads are\\nscheduled on the GPU. For code relying on specific behavior of SIMT scheduling in previous architec-\\ntures, Independent Thread Scheduling may alter the set of participating threads, leading to incorrect\\nresults. To aid migration while implementing the corrective actions detailed in Independent Thread\\nScheduling, Volta developers can opt-in to Pascal’s thread scheduling with the compiler option com-\\nbination -arch=compute_60 -code=sm_70.\\n\\nThe nvcc user manual lists various shorthands for the -arch, -code, and -gencode compiler op-\\ntions. For example, -arch=sm_70 is a shorthand for -arch=compute_70 -code=compute_70,\\nsm_70 (which is the same as -gencode arch=compute_70,code=\\\\\"compute_70,sm_70\\\\\").\\n\\n6.1.5. C++ Compatibility\\n\\nThe front end of the compiler processes CUDA source files according to C++ syntax rules. Full C++ is\\nsupported for the host code. However, only a subset of C++ is fully supported for the device code as\\ndescribed in C++ Language Support.\\n\\n6.1.6. 64-Bit Compatibility\\n\\nThe 64-bit version of nvcc compiles device code in 64-bit mode (i.e., pointers are 64-bit). Device code\\ncompiled in 64-bit mode is only supported with host code compiled in 64-bit mode.\\n\\n6.2. CUDA Runtime\\n\\nThe runtime is implemented in the cudart library, which is linked to the application, either statically\\nvia cudart.lib or libcudart.a, or dynamically via cudart.dll or libcudart.so. Applications\\nthat require cudart.dll and/or cudart.so for dynamic linking typically include them as part of the\\napplication installation package. It is only safe to pass the address of CUDA runtime symbols between\\ncomponents that link to the same instance of the CUDA runtime.\\n\\nAll its entry points are prefixed with cuda.\\n\\nAsmentioned inHeterogeneous Programming, the CUDAprogrammingmodel assumes a systemcom-\\nposed of a host and a device, each with their own separate memory. Device Memory gives an overview\\nof the runtime functions used to manage device memory.\\n\\n24 Chapter 6.

Initialization\\n\\nAs of CUDA 12.0, the cudaInitDevice() and cudaSetDevice() calls initialize the runtime and the\\nprimary context associated with the specified device. Absent these calls, the runtime will implicitly\\nuse device 0 and self-initialize as needed to process other runtime API requests. One needs to keep\\nthis in mind when timing runtime function calls and when interpreting the error code from the first\\ncall into the runtime. Before 12.0, cudaSetDevice()would not initialize the runtime and applications\\nwould often use the no-op runtime call cudaFree(0) to isolate the runtime initialization from other\\napi activity (both for the sake of timing and error handling).\\n\\nThe runtime creates a CUDA context for each device in the system (see Context for more details on\\nCUDA contexts). This context is the primary context for this device and is initialized at the first runtime\\nfunction which requires an active context on this device. It is shared among all the host threads of the\\napplication. As part of this context creation, the device code is just-in-time compiled if necessary (see\\nJust-in-Time Compilation) and loaded into device memory. This all happens transparently. If needed,\\nfor example, for driver API interoperability, the primary context of a device can be accessed from the\\ndriver API as described in Interoperability between Runtime and Driver APIs.\\n\\nWhen a host thread calls cudaDeviceReset(), this destroys the primary context of the device the\\nhost thread currently operates on (i.e., the current device as defined in Device Selection). The next\\nruntime function call made by any host thread that has this device as current will create a new primary\\ncontext for this device.\\n\\nNote: The CUDA interfaces use global state that is initialized during host program initiation and\\ndestroyed during host program termination. The CUDA runtime and driver cannot detect if this state is\\ninvalid, so using any of these interfaces (implicitly or explicitly) during program initiation or termination\\nafter main) will result in undefined behavior.\\n\\nAs of CUDA12.0, cudaSetDevice()will now explicitly initialize the runtime after changing the current\\ndevice for the host thread. Previous versions of CUDA delayed runtime initialization on the new device\\nuntil the first runtime call was made after cudaSetDevice(). This change means that it is now very\\nimportant to check the return value of cudaSetDevice() for initialization errors.\\n\\n6.2.

Kernels operate out of device\\nmemory, so the runtime provides functions to allocate, deallocate, and copy device memory, as well\\nas transfer data between host memory and device memory.\\n\\nDevice memory can be allocated either as linear memory or as CUDA arrays.\\n\\nCUDA arrays are opaquememory layouts optimized for texture fetching. They are described in Texture\\nand Surface Memory.\\n\\nLinear memory is allocated in a single unified address space, which means that separately allocated\\nentities can reference one another via pointers, for example, in a binary tree or linked list. The size of\\nthe address space depends on the host system (CPU) and the compute capability of the used GPU:\\n\\nTable 1: Linear Memory Address Space\\n\\nx86_64 (AMD64) POWER (ppc64le) ARM64\\n\\nup to compute capability 5.3 (Maxwell) 40bit 40bit 40bit\\n\\ncompute capability 6.0 (Pascal) or newer up to 47bit up to 49bit up to 48bit\\n\\nNote: On devices of compute capability 5.3 (Maxwell) and earlier, the CUDA driver creates an un-\\ncommitted 40bit virtual address reservation to ensure that memory allocations (pointers) fall into the\\nsupported range.

On the other hand, if the data is only accessed once, such data\\naccesses can be considered to be streaming.\\n\\nStarting with CUDA 11.0, devices of compute capability 8.0 and above have the capability to influence\\npersistence of data in the L2 cache, potentially providing higher bandwidth and lower latency accesses\\nto global memory.\\n\\n6.2.3.1 L2 cache Set-Aside for Persisting Accesses\\n\\nA portion of the L2 cache can be set aside to be used for persisting data accesses to global mem-\\nory. Persisting accesses have prioritized use of this set-aside portion of L2 cache, whereas normal or\\nstreaming, accesses to global memory can only utilize this portion of L2when it is unused by persisting\\naccesses.\\n\\nThe L2 cache set-aside size for persisting accesses may be adjusted, within limits:\\n\\ncudaGetDeviceProperties(&prop, device_id);\\nsize_t size = min(int(prop.l2CacheSize * 0.75), prop.persistingL2CacheMaxSize);\\ncudaDeviceSetLimit(cudaLimitPersistingL2CacheSize, size); ∕* set-aside 3∕4 of L2 cache�\\n↪→for persisting accesses or the max allowed*∕\\n\\nWhen the GPU is configured in Multi-Instance GPU (MIG) mode, the L2 cache set-aside functionality\\nis disabled.\\n\\nWhen using the Multi-Process Service (MPS), the L2 cache set-aside size cannot be changed by cud-\\naDeviceSetLimit.

In both of the examples above, 60% of the memory accesses in the global memory region\\n[ptr..ptr+num_bytes) have the persisting property and 40% of the memory accesses have the\\nstreaming property. Which specific memory accesses are classified as persisting (the hitProp) is\\n\\n30 Chapter 6. Programming Interface\\n\\n\\n\\nCUDA C++ Programming Guide, Release 12.4\\n\\nrandom with a probability of approximately hitRatio; the probability distribution depends upon the\\nhardware architecture and the memory extent.\\n\\nFor example, if the L2 set-aside cache size is 16KB and the num_bytes in the accessPolicyWindow\\nis 32KB:\\n\\n▶ With a hitRatio of 0.5, the hardware will select, at random, 16KB of the 32KB window to be\\ndesignated as persisting and cached in the set-aside L2 cache area.\\n\\n▶ With a hitRatio of 1.0, the hardware will attempt to cache the whole 32KB window in the set-\\naside L2 cache area. Since the set-aside area is smaller than the window, cache lines will be\\nevicted to keep the most recently used 16KB of the 32KB data in the set-aside portion of the L2\\ncache.\\n\\nThe hitRatio can therefore be used to avoid thrashing of cache lines and overall reduce the amount\\nof data moved into and out of the L2 cache.\\n\\nA hitRatio value below 1.0 can be used tomanually control the amount of data different accessPol-\\nicyWindows from concurrent CUDA streams can cache in L2. For example, let the L2 set-aside cache\\nsize be 16KB; two concurrent kernels in two different CUDA streams, each with a 16KB accessPol-\\nicyWindow, and both with hitRatio value 1.0, might evict each others’ cache lines when competing\\nfor the shared L2 resource. However, if both accessPolicyWindows have a hitRatio value of 0.5, they\\nwill be less likely to evict their own or each others’ persisting cache lines.\\n\\n6.2.3.3 L2 Access Properties\\n\\nThree types of access properties are defined for different global memory data accesses:\\n\\n1. cudaAccessPropertyStreaming: Memory accesses that occur with the streaming property\\nare less likely to persist in the L2 cache because these accesses are preferentially evicted.\\n\\n2. cudaAccessPropertyPersisting: Memory accesses that occur with the persisting property\\nare more likely to persist in the L2 cache because these accesses are preferentially retained in\\nthe set-aside portion of L2 cache.\\n\\n3. cudaAccessPropertyNormal: This access property forcibly resets previously applied persisting\\naccess property to a normal status. Memory accesses with the persisting property from previ-\\nous CUDA kernels may be retained in L2 cache long after their intended use. This persistence-\\nafter-use reduces the amount of L2 cache available to subsequent kernels that do not use the\\npersisting property. Resetting an access property window with the cudaAccessPropertyNor-\\nmal property removes the persisting (preferential retention) status of the prior access, as if the\\nprior access had been without an access property.\\n\\n6.2.3.4 L2 Persistence Example\\n\\nThe following example shows how to set-aside L2 cache for persistent accesses, use the set-aside L2\\ncache in CUDA kernels via CUDA Stream and then reset the L2 cache.\\n\\ncudaStream_t stream;\\ncudaStreamCreate(&stream); �\\n↪→ ∕∕ Create CUDA stream\\n\\ncudaDeviceProp prop; �\\n↪→ ∕∕ CUDA device properties variable\\ncudaGetDeviceProperties( &prop, device_id); �\\n↪→ ∕∕ Query GPU properties\\n\\n(continues on next page)\\n\\n6.2.

There are three ways a persisting access can be reset to normal\\nstatus.\\n\\n1. Reset a previous persisting memory region with the access property, cudaAccessProper-\\ntyNormal.\\n\\n2. Reset all persisting L2 cache lines to normal by calling cudaCtxResetPersistingL2Cache().\\n\\n3. Eventually untouched lines are automatically reset to normal. Reliance on automatic reset is\\n\\n32 Chapter 6.

However, the L2 set-aside cache portion is shared among\\nall these concurrent CUDA kernels. As a result, the net utilization of this set-aside cache portion is\\nthe sum of all the concurrent kernels’ individual use. The benefits of designating memory accesses as\\npersisting diminish as the volume of persisting accesses exceeds the set-aside L2 cache capacity.\\n\\nTo manage utilization of the set-aside L2 cache portion, an application must consider the following:\\n\\n▶ Size of L2 set-aside cache.\\n\\n▶ CUDA kernels that may concurrently execute.\\n\\n▶ The access policy window for all the CUDA kernels that may concurrently execute.\\n\\n▶ When and how L2 reset is required to allow normal or streaming accesses to utilize the previously\\nset-aside L2 cache with equal priority.\\n\\n6.2.3.7 Query L2 cache Properties\\n\\nProperties related to L2 cache are a part of cudaDeviceProp struct and can be queried using CUDA\\nruntime API cudaGetDeviceProperties\\n\\nCUDA Device Properties include:\\n\\n▶ l2CacheSize: The amount of available L2 cache on the GPU.\\n\\n▶ persistingL2CacheMaxSize: Themaximum amount of L2 cache that can be set-aside for per-\\nsisting memory accesses.\\n\\n▶ accessPolicyMaxWindowSize: The maximum size of the access policy window.\\n\\n6.2.3.8 Control L2 Cache Set-Aside Size for Persisting Memory Access\\n\\nThe L2 set-aside cache size for persisting memory accesses is queried using CUDA runtime API cu-\\ndaDeviceGetLimit and set using CUDA runtime API cudaDeviceSetLimit as a cudaLimit.

In this implementation, each thread block is responsible for computing one square\\nsub-matrix Csub of C and each thread within the block is responsible for computing one element of\\nCsub. As illustrated in Figure 9, Csub is equal to the product of two rectangular matrices: the sub-\\nmatrix of A of dimension (A.width, block_size) that has the same row indices as Csub, and the sub-\\nmatrix of B of dimension (block_size, A.width )that has the same column indices as Csub. In order to fit\\ninto the device’s resources, these two rectangularmatrices are divided into asmany squarematrices of\\ndimension block_size as necessary and Csub is computed as the sum of the products of these square\\nmatrices. Each of these products is performed by first loading the two corresponding squarematrices\\nfrom global memory to shared memory with one thread loading one element of each matrix, and then\\nby having each thread compute one element of the product. Each thread accumulates the result of\\neach of these products into a register and once done writes the result to global memory.\\n\\nBy blocking the computation this way, we take advantage of fast shared memory and save a lot of\\nglobal memory bandwidth since A is only read (B.width / block_size) times from global memory and B\\nis read (A.height / block_size) times.\\n\\nTheMatrix type from the previous code sample is augmented with a stride field, so that sub-matrices\\ncan be efficiently represented with the same type. __device__ functions are used to get and set ele-\\nments and build any sub-matrix from a matrix.\\n\\n∕∕ Matrices are stored in row-major order:\\n∕∕ M(row, col) = *(M.elements + row * M.stride + col)\\ntypedef struct {\\n\\nint width;\\nint height;\\nint stride;\\nfloat* elements;\\n\\n} Matrix;\\n∕∕ Get a matrix element\\n__device__ float GetElement(const Matrix A, int row, int col)\\n\\n(continues on next page)\\n\\n6.2.

CUDA Runtime 39\\n\\n\\n\\nCUDA C++ Programming Guide, Release 12.4\\n\\n6.2.5. Distributed Shared Memory\\n\\nThread block clusters introduced in compute capability 9.0 provide the ability for threads in a thread\\nblock cluster to access shared memory of all the participating thread blocks in a cluster. This parti-\\ntioned shared memory is called Distributed Shared Memory, and the corresponding address space is\\ncalled Distributed shared memory address space. Threads that belong to a thread block cluster, can\\nread, write or perform atomics in the distributed address space, regardless whether the address be-\\nlongs to the local thread block or a remote thread block. Whether a kernel uses distributed shared\\nmemory or not, the shared memory size specifications, static or dynamic is still per thread block. The\\nsize of distributed shared memory is just the number of thread blocks per cluster multiplied by the\\nsize of shared memory per thread block.\\n\\nAccessing data in distributed shared memory requires all the thread blocks to exist. A user can guar-\\nantee that all thread blocks have started executing using cluster.sync() from Cluster Group API.\\nThe user also needs to ensure that all distributed shared memory operations happen before the exit\\nof a thread block, e.g., if a remote thread block is trying to read a given thread block’s shared memory,\\nuser needs to ensure that the shared memory read by remote thread block is completed before it can\\nexit.\\n\\nCUDA provides a mechanism to access to distributed shared memory, and applications can benefit\\nfrom leveraging its capabilities. Lets look at a simple histogram computation and how to optimize it\\non the GPU using thread block cluster. A standard way of computing histograms is do the computa-\\ntion in the sharedmemory of each thread block and then perform global memory atomics. A limitation\\nof this approach is the shared memory capacity. Once the histogram bins no longer fit in the shared\\nmemory, a user needs to directly compute histograms and hence the atomics in the global memory.\\nWith distributed shared memory, CUDA provides an intermediate step, where a depending on the his-\\ntogram bins size, histogram can be computed in shared memory, distributed shared memory or global\\nmemory directly.\\n\\nThe CUDA kernel example below shows how to compute histograms in shared memory or distributed\\nshared memory, depending on the number of histogram bins.\\n\\n#include <cooperative_groups.h>\\n\\n∕∕ Distributed Shared memory histogram kernel\\n__global__ void clusterHist_kernel(int *bins, const int nbins, const int bins_per_\\n↪→block, const int *__restrict__ input,\\n\\nsize_t array_size)\\n{\\n\\nextern __shared__ int smem[];\\nnamespace cg = cooperative_groups;\\nint tid = cg::this_grid().thread_rank();\\n\\n∕∕ Cluster initialization, size and calculating local bin offsets.\\ncg::cluster_group cluster = cg::this_cluster();\\nunsigned int clusterBlockRank = cluster.block_rank();\\nint cluster_size = cluster.dim_blocks().x;\\n\\nfor (int i = threadIdx.x; i < bins_per_block; i += blockDim.x)\\n{\\n\\nsmem[i] = 0; ∕∕Initialize shared memory histogram to zeros\\n}\\n\\n∕∕ cluster synchronization ensures that shared memory is initialized to zero in\\n∕∕ all thread blocks in the cluster.

Page-Locked Host Memory\\n\\nThe runtime provides functions to allow the use of page-locked (also known as pinned) host memory\\n(as opposed to regular pageable host memory allocated by malloc()):\\n\\n▶ cudaHostAlloc() and cudaFreeHost() allocate and free page-locked host memory;\\n\\n▶ cudaHostRegister() page-locks a range of memory allocated by malloc() (see reference\\nmanual for limitations).\\n\\nUsing page-locked host memory has several benefits:\\n\\n▶ Copies between page-locked host memory and device memory can be performed concurrently\\nwith kernel execution for some devices as mentioned in Asynchronous Concurrent Execution.\\n\\n▶ On some devices, page-locked hostmemory can bemapped into the address space of the device,\\neliminating the need to copy it to or from device memory as detailed in Mapped Memory.\\n\\n▶ On systemswith a front-side bus, bandwidth between hostmemory and devicememory is higher\\nif host memory is allocated as page-locked and even higher if in addition it is allocated as write-\\ncombining as described in Write-Combining Memory.\\n\\nNote: Page-locked host memory is not cached on non I/O coherent Tegra devices. Also, cuda-\\nHostRegister() is not supported on non I/O coherent Tegra devices.\\n\\nThe simple zero-copy CUDA sample comeswith a detailed document on the page-lockedmemory APIs.\\n\\n42 Chapter 6.

To make these advantages available to all devices, the\\nblock needs to be allocated by passing the flag cudaHostAllocPortable to cudaHostAlloc() or\\npage-locked by passing the flag cudaHostRegisterPortable to cudaHostRegister().\\n\\n6.2.6.2 Write-Combining Memory\\n\\nBy default page-locked host memory is allocated as cacheable. It can optionally be allocated as write-\\ncombining instead by passing flag cudaHostAllocWriteCombined to cudaHostAlloc(). Write-\\ncombiningmemory frees up the host’s L1 and L2 cache resources, makingmore cache available to the\\nrest of the application. In addition, write-combining memory is not snooped during transfers across\\nthe PCI Express bus, which can improve transfer performance by up to 40%.\\n\\nReading fromwrite-combiningmemory from thehost is prohibitively slow, sowrite-combiningmemory\\nshould in general be used for memory that the host only writes to.\\n\\nUsingCPU atomic instructions onWCmemory should be avoided because not all CPU implementations\\nguarantee that functionality.\\n\\n6.2.6.3 Mapped Memory\\n\\nA block of page-locked hostmemory can also bemapped into the address space of the device by pass-\\ning flag cudaHostAllocMapped to cudaHostAlloc() or by passing flag cudaHostRegisterMapped\\nto cudaHostRegister(). Such a block has therefore in general two addresses: one in host memory\\nthat is returned by cudaHostAlloc() or malloc(), and one in device memory that can be retrieved\\nusing cudaHostGetDevicePointer() and then used to access the block from within a kernel. The\\nonly exception is for pointers allocated with cudaHostAlloc() and when a unified address space is\\nused for the host and the device as mentioned in Unified Virtual Address Space.\\n\\nAccessing host memory directly from within a kernel does not provide the same bandwidth as device\\nmemory, but does have some advantages:\\n\\n▶ There is no need to allocate a block in device memory and copy data between this block and the\\nblock in host memory; data transfers are implicitly performed as needed by the kernel;\\n\\n▶ There is no need to use streams (see Concurrent Data Transfers) to overlap data transfers with\\nkernel execution; the kernel-originated data transfers automatically overlap with kernel execu-\\ntion.\\n\\nSince mapped page-locked memory is shared between host and device however, the application must\\nsynchronize memory accesses using streams or events (see Asynchronous Concurrent Execution) to\\navoid any potential read-after-write, write-after-read, or write-after-write hazards.\\n\\nTo be able to retrieve the device pointer to any mapped page-locked memory, page-locked memory\\nmappingmust be enabled by calling cudaSetDeviceFlags()with the cudaDeviceMapHost flag be-\\nfore any other CUDA call is performed. Otherwise, cudaHostGetDevicePointer() will return an\\nerror.\\n\\ncudaHostGetDevicePointer() also returns an error if the device does not support mapped page-\\nlocked host memory. Applications may query this capability by checking the canMapHostMemory de-\\n\\n6.2.

On some platforms, atomics to memory may be broken by\\nthe hardware into separate load and store operations. These component load and store operations\\nhave the same requirements on preservation of naturally aligned accesses. As an example, the CUDA\\nruntime does not support a PCI Express bus topologywhere a PCI Express bridge splits 8-byte naturally\\naligned writes into two 4-byte writes between the device and the host.\\n\\n6.2.7. Memory Synchronization Domains\\n\\n6.2.7.1 Memory Fence Interference\\n\\nSome CUDA applications may see degraded performance due to memory fence/flush operations wait-\\ning on more transactions than those necessitated by the CUDA memory consistency model.\\n\\n__managed__ int x = 0;\\n__device__ cuda::atomic\\n↪→<int, cuda::thread_scope_\\n↪→device> a(0);\\n__managed__ cuda::atomic\\n↪→<int, cuda::thread_scope_\\n↪→system> b(0);\\n\\nThread 1 (SM)\\n\\nx = 1;\\na = 1;\\n\\nThread 2 (SM)\\n\\nwhile (a != 1) ;\\nassert(x == 1);\\nb = 1;\\n\\nThread 3 (CPU)\\n\\nwhile (b != 1) ;\\nassert(x == 1);\\n\\nConsider the example above. The CUDA memory consistency model guarantees that the asserted\\ncondition will be true, so the write to x from thread 1 must be visible to thread 3, before the write to\\nb from thread 2.\\n\\nThe memory ordering provided by the release and acquire of a is only sufficient to make x visible to\\nthread 2, not thread 3, as it is a device-scope operation. The system-scope ordering provided by release\\nand acquire of b, therefore, needs to ensure not only writes issued from thread 2 itself are visible to\\nthread 3, but also writes from other threads that are visible to thread 2. This is known as cumulativity.\\nAs the GPU cannot know at the time of execution which writes have been guaranteed at the source\\nlevel to be visible and which are visible only by chance timing, it must cast a conservatively wide net\\nfor in-flight memory operations.\\n\\nThis sometimes leads to interference: because the GPU is waiting on memory operations it is not\\nrequired to at the source level, the fence/flush may take longer than necessary.\\n\\nNote that fences may occur explicitly as intrinsics or atomics in code, like in the example, or implicitly\\nto implement synchronizes-with relationships at task boundaries.\\n\\n44 Chapter 6. Programming Interface\\n\\nindex.html#device-enumeration\\nindex.html#atomic-functions\\n\\n\\nCUDA C++ Programming Guide, Release 12.4\\n\\nA common example is when a kernel is performing computation in local GPU memory, and a parallel\\nkernel (e.g. from NCCL) is performing communications with a peer. Upon completion, the local ker-\\nnel will implicitly flush its writes to satisfy any synchronizes-with relationships to downstream work.\\nThis may unnecessarily wait, fully or partially, on slower nvlink or PCIe writes from the communication\\nkernel.\\n\\n6.2.7.2 Isolating Traffic with Domains\\n\\nBeginning with Hopper architecture GPUs and CUDA 12.0, the memory synchronization domains fea-\\nture provides a way to alleviate such interference. In exchange for explicit assistance from code, the\\nGPU can reduce the net cast by a fence operation. Each kernel launch is given a domain ID. Writes\\nand fences are tagged with the ID, and a fence will only order writes matching the fence’s domain. In\\nthe concurrent compute vs communication example, the communication kernels can be placed in a\\ndifferent domain.\\n\\nWhen using domains, code must abide by the rule that ordering or synchronization between distinct\\ndomains on the same GPU requires system-scope fencing. Within a domain, device-scope fencing\\nremains sufficient. This is necessary for cumulativity as one kernel’s writes will not be encompassed\\nby a fence issued from a kernel in another domain. In essence, cumulativity is satisfied by ensuring\\nthat cross-domain traffic is flushed to the system scope ahead of time.\\n\\nNote that this modifies the definition of thread_scope_device. However, because kernels will de-\\nfault to domain 0 as described below, backward compatibility is maintained.\\n\\n6.2.7.3 Using Domains in CUDA\\n\\nDomains are accessible via the new launch attributes cudaLaunchAttributeMemSyncDomain and\\ncudaLaunchAttributeMemSyncDomainMap. The former selects between logical domains cud-\\naLaunchMemSyncDomainDefault and cudaLaunchMemSyncDomainRemote, and the latter provides\\na mapping from logical to physical domains. The remote domain is intended for kernels performing\\nremote memory access in order to isolate their memory traffic from local kernels. Note, however, the\\nselection of a particular domain does not affect what memory access a kernel may legally perform.\\n\\nThe domain count can be queried via device attribute cudaDevAttrMemSyncDomainCount. Hopper\\nhas 4 domains. To facilitate portable code, domains functionality can be used on all devices and CUDA\\nwill report a count of 1 prior to Hopper.\\n\\nHaving logical domains eases application composition. An individual kernel launch at a low level in the\\nstack, such as from NCCL, can select a semantic logical domain without concern for the surrounding\\napplication architecture. Higher levels can steer logical domains using the mapping. The default value\\nfor the logical domain if it is not set is the default domain, and the default mapping is to map the\\ndefault domain to 0 and the remote domain to 1 (on GPUs with more than 1 domain). Specific libraries\\nmay tag launches with the remote domain in CUDA 12.0 and later; for example, NCCL 2.16 will do so.\\nTogether, this provides a beneficial use pattern for common applications out of the box, with no code\\nchanges needed in other components, frameworks, or at application level. An alternative use pattern,\\nfor example in an application using nvshmem or with no clear separation of kernel types, could be to\\npartition parallel streams. Stream A may map both logical domains to physical domain 0, stream B to\\n1, and so on.\\n\\n∕∕ Example of launching a kernel with the remote logical domain\\ncudaLaunchAttribute domainAttr;\\ndomainAttr.id = cudaLaunchAttrMemSyncDomain;\\ndomainAttr.val = cudaLaunchMemSyncDomainRemote;\\ncudaLaunchConfig_t config;\\n\\n(continues on next page)\\n\\n6.2.

Graphs take both attributes from\\nthe node itself, essentially an indirect way of specifying a physical domain. Domain-related attributes\\nset on the stream a graph is launched into are not used in execution of the graph.\\n\\n6.2.8. Asynchronous Concurrent Execution\\n\\nCUDA exposes the following operations as independent tasks that can operate concurrently with one\\nanother:\\n\\n▶ Computation on the host;\\n\\n▶ Computation on the device;\\n\\n▶ Memory transfers from the host to the device;\\n\\n▶ Memory transfers from the device to the host;\\n\\n▶ Memory transfers within the memory of a given device;\\n\\n▶ Memory transfers among devices.\\n\\nThe level of concurrency achieved between these operations will depend on the feature set and com-\\npute capability of the device as described below.\\n\\n46 Chapter 6. Programming Interface\\n\\n\\n\\nCUDA C++ Programming Guide, Release 12.4\\n\\n6.2.8.1 Concurrent Execution between Host and Device\\n\\nConcurrent host execution is facilitated through asynchronous library functions that return control\\nto the host thread before the device completes the requested task. Using asynchronous calls, many\\ndevice operations can be queued up together to be executed by the CUDA driver when appropriate de-\\nvice resources are available. This relieves the host thread of much of the responsibility to manage the\\ndevice, leaving it free for other tasks. The following device operations are asynchronous with respect\\nto the host:\\n\\n▶ Kernel launches;\\n\\n▶ Memory copies within a single device’s memory;\\n\\n▶ Memory copies from host to device of a memory block of 64 KB or less;\\n\\n▶ Memory copies performed by functions that are suffixed with Async;\\n\\n▶ Memory set function calls.\\n\\nProgrammers can globally disable asynchronicity of kernel launches for all CUDA applications running\\non a system by setting the CUDA_LAUNCH_BLOCKING environment variable to 1. This feature is pro-\\nvided for debugging purposes only and should not be used as a way to make production software run\\nreliably.\\n\\nKernel launches are synchronous if hardware counters are collected via a profiler (Nsight, Visual Pro-\\nfiler) unless concurrent kernel profiling is enabled. Async memory copies might also be synchronous\\nif they involve host memory that is not page-locked.\\n\\n6.2.8.2 Concurrent Kernel Execution\\n\\nSome devices of compute capability 2.x and higher can execute multiple kernels concurrently. Appli-\\ncations may query this capability by checking the concurrentKernels device property (see Device\\nEnumeration), which is equal to 1 for devices that support it.\\n\\nThe maximum number of kernel launches that a device can execute concurrently depends on its com-\\npute capability and is listed in Table 21.\\n\\nA kernel from one CUDA context cannot execute concurrently with a kernel from another CUDA con-\\ntext. The GPU may time slice to provide forward progress to each context. If a user wants to run\\nkernels from multiple process simultaneously on the SM, one must enable MPS.\\n\\nKernels that use many textures or a large amount of local memory are less likely to execute concur-\\nrently with other kernels.\\n\\n6.2.8.3 Overlap of Data Transfer and Kernel Execution\\n\\nSome devices can perform an asynchronousmemory copy to or from the GPU concurrently with kernel\\nexecution. Applicationsmayquery this capability by checking theasyncEngineCountdevice property\\n(see Device Enumeration), which is greater than zero for devices that support it. If host memory is\\ninvolved in the copy, it must be page-locked.\\n\\nIt is also possible to perform an intra-device copy simultaneously with kernel execution (on devices\\nthat support the concurrentKernels device property) and/or with copies to or from the device (for\\ndevices that support the asyncEngineCount property). Intra-device copies are initiated using the\\nstandard memory copy functions with destination and source addresses residing on the same device.\\n\\n6.2.

Ap-\\nplications may query this capability by checking the asyncEngineCount device property (see Device\\nEnumeration), which is equal to 2 for devices that support it. In order to be overlapped, any host\\nmemory involved in the transfers must be page-locked.\\n\\n6.2.8.5 Streams\\n\\nApplications manage the concurrent operations described above through streams. A stream is a se-\\nquence of commands (possibly issued by different host threads) that execute in order. Different\\nstreams, on the other hand, may execute their commands out of order with respect to one another\\nor concurrently; this behavior is not guaranteed and should therefore not be relied upon for correct-\\nness (for example, inter-kernel communication is undefined). The commands issued on a stream may\\nexecute when all the dependencies of the command are met. The dependencies could be previously\\nlaunched commands on same streamor dependencies fromother streams. The successful completion\\nof synchronize call guarantees that all the commands launched are completed.\\n\\n6.2.8.5.1 Creation and Destruction of Streams\\n\\nA stream is defined by creating a stream object and specifying it as the stream parameter to a se-\\nquence of kernel launches and host <-> device memory copies. The following code sample creates\\ntwo streams and allocates an array hostPtr of float in page-locked memory.\\n\\ncudaStream_t stream[2];\\nfor (int i = 0; i < 2; ++i)\\n\\ncudaStreamCreate(&stream[i]);\\nfloat* hostPtr;\\ncudaMallocHost(&hostPtr, 2 * size);\\n\\nEach of these streams is defined by the following code sample as a sequence of one memory copy\\nfrom host to device, one kernel launch, and one memory copy from device to host:\\n\\nfor (int i = 0; i < 2; ++i) {\\ncudaMemcpyAsync(inputDevPtr + i * size, hostPtr + i * size,\\n\\nsize, cudaMemcpyHostToDevice, stream[i]);\\nMyKernel <<<100, 512, 0, stream[i]>>>\\n\\n(outputDevPtr + i * size, inputDevPtr + i * size, size);\\ncudaMemcpyAsync(hostPtr + i * size, outputDevPtr + i * size,\\n\\nsize, cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost, stream[i]);\\n}\\n\\nEach stream copies its portion of input array hostPtr to array inputDevPtr in device memory, pro-\\ncesses inputDevPtr on the device by calling MyKernel(), and copies the result outputDevPtr back\\nto the same portion of hostPtr. Overlapping Behavior describes how the streams overlap in this ex-\\nample depending on the capability of the device. Note that hostPtrmust point to page-locked host\\nmemory for any overlap to occur.\\n\\nStreams are released by calling cudaStreamDestroy().\\n\\nfor (int i = 0; i < 2; ++i)\\ncudaStreamDestroy(stream[i]);\\n\\n48 Chapter 6.

They are therefore\\nexecuted in order.\\n\\nFor code that is compiled using the--default-stream per-thread compilationflag (or that defines\\nthe CUDA_API_PER_THREAD_DEFAULT_STREAM macro before including CUDA headers (cuda.h and\\ncuda_runtime.h)), the default stream is a regular stream and each host thread has its own default\\nstream.\\n\\nNote: #define CUDA_API_PER_THREAD_DEFAULT_STREAM 1 cannot be used to enable this be-\\nhavior when the code is compiled by nvcc as nvcc implicitly includes cuda_runtime.h at the top\\nof the translation unit. In this case the --default-stream per-thread compilation flag needs\\nto be used or the CUDA_API_PER_THREAD_DEFAULT_STREAM macro needs to be defined with the\\n-DCUDA_API_PER_THREAD_DEFAULT_STREAM=1 compiler flag.\\n\\nFor code that is compiled using the --default-stream legacy compilation flag, the default stream\\nis a special stream called the NULL stream and each device has a single NULL stream used for all\\nhost threads. The NULL stream is special as it causes implicit synchronization as described in Implicit\\nSynchronization.\\n\\nFor code that is compiled without specifying a --default-stream compilation flag,\\n--default-stream legacy is assumed as the default.\\n\\n6.2.8.5.3 Explicit Synchronization\\n\\nThere are various ways to explicitly synchronize streams with each other.\\n\\ncudaDeviceSynchronize() waits until all preceding commands in all streams of all host threads\\nhave completed.\\n\\ncudaStreamSynchronize()takes a stream as a parameter and waits until all preceding commands\\nin the given stream have completed. It can be used to synchronize the host with a specific stream,\\nallowing other streams to continue executing on the device.\\n\\ncudaStreamWaitEvent()takes a stream and an event as parameters (see Events for a description of\\nevents)and makes all the commands added to the given stream after the call to cudaStreamWait-\\nEvent()delay their execution until the given event has completed.\\n\\ncudaStreamQuery()provides applications with a way to know if all preceding commands in a stream\\nhave completed.\\n\\n6.2.

A typical GPU\\nactivity timeline is shown in Figure 10.\\n\\nFigure 10: GPU activity timeline\\n\\nHere, secondary_kernel is launched after primary_kernel finishes its execution. Serialized exe-\\ncution is usually necessary because secondary_kernel depends on result data produced by pri-\\nmary_kernel. If secondary_kernel has no dependency on primary_kernel, both of them can\\nbe launched concurrently by using CUDA streams. Even if secondary_kernel is dependent on pri-\\nmary_kernel, there is some potential for concurrent execution. For example, almost all the kernels\\nhave some sort of preamble section during which tasks such as zeroing buffers or loading constant\\nvalues are performed.\\n\\nFigure 11: Preamble section of secondary_kernel\\n\\nFigure 11 demonstrates the portion of secondary_kernel that could be executed concurrently with-\\nout impacting the application.

The primary kernel should execute cudaTriggerProgrammaticLaunchCompletion with\\nall thread blocks when it’s ready for the secondary kernel to launch.

If the primary kernel doesn’t execute the\\ntrigger, it implicitly occurs after all thread blocks in the primary kernel exit.\\n\\n6.2. CUDA Runtime 53\\n\\n\\n\\nCUDA C++ Programming Guide, Release 12.4\\n\\nIn either case, the secondary thread blocks might launch before data written by the primary kernel\\nis visible. As such, when the secondary kernel is configured with Programmatic Dependent Launch, it\\nmust always use cudaGridDependencySynchronize or other means to verify that the result data\\nfrom the primary is available.\\n\\nPlease note that these methods provide the opportunity for the primary and secondary kernels to\\nexecute concurrently, however this behavior is opportunistic and not guaranteed to lead to concurrent\\nkernel execution. Reliance on concurrent execution in this manner is unsafe and can lead to deadlock.\\n\\n6.2.8.6.3 Use in CUDA Graphs\\n\\nProgrammatic Dependent Launch can be used in CUDA Graphs via stream capture or directly via edge\\ndata. To program this feature in a CUDA Graph with edge data, use a cudaGraphDependencyType\\nvalue of cudaGraphDependencyTypeProgrammatic on an edge connecting two kernel nodes. This\\nedge typemakes the upstreamkernel visible to a cudaGridDependencySynchronize() in the down-\\nstream kernel. This type must be used with an outgoing port of either cudaGraphKernelNodePort-\\nLaunchCompletion or cudaGraphKernelNodePortProgrammatic.\\n\\nThe resulting graph equivalents for stream capture are as follows:\\n\\nStream code (abbreviated) Resulting graph edge\\n\\ncudaLaunchAttribute attribute;\\nattribute.id =�\\n↪→cudaLaunchAttributeProgrammaticStreamSerialization;\\n↪→\\n\\nattribute.val.\\n↪→programmaticStreamSerializationAllowed�\\n↪→= 1;\\n\\ncudaGraphEdgeData edgeData;\\nedgeData.type =�\\n↪→cudaGraphDependencyTypeProgrammatic;\\nedgeData.from_port =�\\n↪→cudaGraphKernelNodePortProgrammatic;\\n\\ncudaLaunchAttribute attribute;\\nattribute.id =�\\n↪→cudaLaunchAttributeProgrammaticEvent;\\nattribute.val.programmaticEvent.\\n↪→triggerAtBlockStart = 0;\\n\\ncudaGraphEdgeData edgeData;\\nedgeData.type =�\\n↪→cudaGraphDependencyTypeProgrammatic;\\nedgeData.from_port =�\\n↪→cudaGraphKernelNodePortProgrammatic;\\n\\ncudaLaunchAttribute attribute;\\nattribute.id =�\\n↪→cudaLaunchAttributeProgrammaticEvent;\\nattribute.val.programmaticEvent.\\n↪→triggerAtBlockStart = 1;\\n\\ncudaGraphEdgeData edgeData;\\nedgeData.type =�\\n↪→cudaGraphDependencyTypeProgrammatic;\\nedgeData.from_port =�\\n↪→cudaGraphKernelNodePortLaunchCompletion;\\n↪→\\n\\n54 Chapter 6.

A graph is a series of operations,\\nsuch as kernel launches, connected by dependencies, which is defined separately from its execution.\\nThis allows a graph to be defined once and then launched repeatedly. Separating out the definition\\nof a graph from its execution enables a number of optimizations: first, CPU launch costs are reduced\\ncompared to streams, because much of the setup is done in advance; second, presenting the whole\\nworkflow to CUDA enables optimizations which might not be possible with the piecewise work sub-\\nmission mechanism of streams.\\n\\nTo see the optimizations possible with graphs, consider what happens in a stream: when you place a\\nkernel into a stream, the host driver performs a sequence of operations in preparation for the execu-\\ntion of the kernel on the GPU. These operations, necessary for setting up and launching the kernel,\\nare an overhead cost which must be paid for each kernel that is issued. For a GPU kernel with a short\\nexecution time, this overhead cost can be a significant fraction of the overall end-to-end execution\\ntime.\\n\\nWork submission using graphs is separated into three distinct stages: definition, instantiation, and\\nexecution.\\n\\n▶ During the definition phase, a program creates a description of the operations in the graph along\\nwith the dependencies between them.\\n\\n▶ Instantiation takes a snapshot of the graph template, validates it, and performs much of the\\nsetup and initialization of work with the aim of minimizing what needs to be done at launch. The\\nresulting instance is known as an executable graph.\\n\\n▶ An executable graph may be launched into a stream, similar to any other CUDA work. It may be\\nlaunched any number of times without repeating the instantiation.\\n\\n6.2.8.7.1 Graph Structure\\n\\nAn operation forms a node in a graph. The dependencies between the operations are the edges. These\\ndependencies constrain the execution sequence of the operations.\\n\\nAn operationmay be scheduled at any time once the nodes onwhich it depends are complete. Schedul-\\ning is left up to the CUDA system.\\n\\n6.2.8.7.1.1 Node Types\\n\\nA graph node can be one of:\\n\\n▶ kernel\\n\\n▶ CPU function call\\n\\n▶ memory copy\\n\\n▶ memset\\n\\n▶ empty node\\n\\n▶ waiting on an event\\n\\n▶ recording an event\\n\\n▶ signalling an external semaphore\\n\\n▶ waiting on an external semaphore\\n\\n6.2.

Edge data modifies a dependency specified by an\\nedge and consists of three parts: an outgoing port, an incoming port, and a type. An outgoing port\\nspecifies when an associated edge is triggered. An incoming port specifies what portion of a node is\\ndependent on an associated edge. A type modifies the relation between the endpoints.\\n\\nPort values are specific to node type and direction, and edge types may be restricted to specific node\\ntypes. In all cases, zero-initialized edge data represents default behavior. Outgoing port 0 waits on an\\nentire task, incoming port 0 blocks an entire task, and edge type 0 is associated with a full dependency\\nwith memory synchronizing behavior.\\n\\nEdge data is optionally specified in various graph APIs via a parallel array to the associated nodes. If\\nit is omitted as an input parameter, zero-initialized data is used. If it is omitted as an output (query)\\nparameter, the API accepts this if the edge data being ignored is all zero-initialized, and returns cud-\\naErrorLossyQuery if the call would discard information.\\n\\nEdge data is also available in some stream capture APIs: cudaStreamBeginCaptureToGraph(), cu-\\ndaStreamGetCaptureInfo(), and cudaStreamUpdateCaptureDependencies(). In these cases,\\nthere is not yet a downstream node. The data is associated with a dangling edge (half edge) which\\nwill either be connected to a future captured node or discarded at termination of stream capture.\\nNote that some edge types do not wait on full completion of the upstream node. These edges are\\nignored when considering if a stream capture has been fully rejoined to the origin stream, and cannot\\nbe discarded at the end of capture. See Creating a Graph Using Stream Capture.\\n\\nCurrently, no node types define additional incoming ports, and only kernel nodes define additional out-\\ngoing ports. There is one non-default dependency type, cudaGraphDependencyTypeProgrammatic,\\nwhich enables Programmatic Dependent Launch between two kernel nodes.\\n\\n56 Chapter 6.

CUDA Runtime 57\\n\\n\\n\\nCUDA C++ Programming Guide, Release 12.4\\n\\n6.2.8.7.3 Creating a Graph Using Stream Capture\\n\\nStream capture provides a mechanism to create a graph from existing stream-based APIs. A section\\nof code which launches work into streams, including existing code, can be bracketed with calls to\\ncudaStreamBeginCapture() and cudaStreamEndCapture(). See below.\\n\\ncudaGraph_t graph;\\n\\ncudaStreamBeginCapture(stream);\\n\\nkernel_A<<< ..., stream >>>(...);\\nkernel_B<<< ..., stream >>>(...);\\nlibraryCall(stream);\\nkernel_C<<< ..., stream >>>(...);\\n\\ncudaStreamEndCapture(stream, &graph);\\n\\nA call to cudaStreamBeginCapture() places a stream in capture mode. When a stream is being\\ncaptured, work launched into the stream is not enqueued for execution. It is instead appended to\\nan internal graph that is progressively being built up. This graph is then returned by calling cudaS-\\ntreamEndCapture(), which also ends capture mode for the stream. A graph which is actively being\\nconstructed by stream capture is referred to as a capture graph.\\n\\nStream capture can be used on any CUDA stream except cudaStreamLegacy (the “NULL stream”).\\nNote that it can be used on cudaStreamPerThread. If a program is using the legacy stream, it may\\nbe possible to redefine stream 0 to be the per-thread stream with no functional change. See Default\\nStream.\\n\\nWhether a stream is being captured can be queried with cudaStreamIsCapturing().\\n\\nWork can be captured to an existing graph using cudaStreamBeginCaptureToGraph(). Instead of\\ncapturing to an internal graph, work is captured to a graph provided by the user.\\n\\n6.2.8.7.3.1 Cross-stream Dependencies and Events\\n\\nStream capture can handle cross-streamdependencies expressedwith cudaEventRecord() and cu-\\ndaStreamWaitEvent(), provided the event being waited upon was recorded into the same capture\\ngraph.\\n\\nWhen an event is recorded in a stream that is in capturemode, it results in a captured event. A captured\\nevent represents a set of nodes in a capture graph.\\n\\nWhen a captured event is waited on by a stream, it places the stream in capturemode if it is not already,\\nand the next item in the stream will have additional dependencies on the nodes in the captured event.\\nThe two streams are then being captured to the same capture graph.\\n\\nWhen cross-stream dependencies are present in stream capture, cudaStreamEndCapture() must\\nstill be called in the same stream where cudaStreamBeginCapture() was called; this is the origin\\nstream. Any other streams which are being captured to the same capture graph, due to event-based\\ndependencies, must also be joined back to the origin stream. This is illustrated below. All streamsbeing\\ncaptured to the same capture graph are taken out of capturemode upon cudaStreamEndCapture().\\nFailure to rejoin to the origin stream will result in failure of the overall capture operation.\\n\\n∕∕ stream1 is the origin stream\\ncudaStreamBeginCapture(stream1);\\n\\n(continues on next page)\\n\\n58 Chapter 6.

It is also invalid to\\nquery the execution status of or synchronize a broader handle which encompasses an active stream\\ncapture, such as a device or context handle when any associated stream is in capture mode.\\n\\nWhen any stream in the same context is being captured, and it was not created with cudaStream-\\nNonBlocking, any attempted use of the legacy stream is invalid. This is because the legacy stream\\nhandle at all times encompasses these other streams; enqueueing to the legacy stream would cre-\\nate a dependency on the streams being captured, and querying it or synchronizing it would query or\\nsynchronize the streams being captured.\\n\\nIt is therefore also invalid to call synchronous APIs in this case. Synchronous APIs, such as cudaMem-\\ncpy(), enqueue work to the legacy stream and synchronize it before returning.\\n\\nNote: As a general rule, when a dependency relation would connect something that is captured with\\nsomething that was not captured and instead enqueued for execution, CUDA prefers to return an error\\nrather than ignore the dependency. An exception is made for placing a stream into or out of capture\\nmode; this severs a dependency relation between items added to the stream immediately before and\\nafter the mode transition.\\n\\nIt is invalid to merge two separate capture graphs by waiting on a captured event from a stream which\\nis being captured and is associated with a different capture graph than the event. It is invalid to wait\\non a non-captured event from a streamwhich is being captured without specifying the cudaEventWai-\\ntExternal flag.\\n\\n6.2. CUDA Runtime 59\\n\\nindex.html#creating-a-graph-using-api-fig-creating-using-graph-apis\\n\\n\\nCUDA C++ Programming Guide, Release 12.4\\n\\nA small number of APIs that enqueue asynchronous operations into streams are not currently sup-\\nported in graphs and will return an error if called with a stream which is being captured, such as cud-\\naStreamAttachMemAsync().\\n\\n6.2.8.7.3.3 Invalidation\\n\\nWhen an invalid operation is attempted during stream capture, any associated capture graphs are\\ninvalidated. When a capture graph is invalidated, further use of any streams which are being captured\\nor captured events associated with the graph is invalid and will return an error, until stream capture\\nis ended with cudaStreamEndCapture(). This call will take the associated streams out of capture\\nmode, but will also return an error value and a NULL graph.\\n\\n6.2.8.7.4 CUDA User Objects\\n\\nCUDA User Objects can be used to help manage the lifetime of resources used by asynchronous work\\nin CUDA. In particular, this feature is useful for CUDA Graphs and stream capture.\\n\\nVarious resource management schemes are not compatible with CUDA graphs. Consider for example\\nan event-based pool or a synchronous-create, asynchronous-destroy scheme.\\n\\n∕∕ Library API with pool allocation\\nvoid libraryWork(cudaStream_t stream) {\\n\\nauto &resource = pool.claimTemporaryResource();\\nresource.waitOnReadyEventInStream(stream);\\nlaunchWork(stream, resource);\\nresource.recordReadyEvent(stream);\\n\\n}\\n\\n∕∕ Library API with asynchronous resource deletion\\nvoid libraryWork(cudaStream_t stream) {\\n\\nResource *resource = new Resource(...);\\nlaunchWork(stream, resource);\\ncudaStreamAddCallback(\\n\\nstream,\\n[](cudaStream_t, cudaError_t, void *resource) {\\n\\ndelete static_cast<Resource *>(resource);\\n},\\nresource,\\n0);\\n\\n∕∕ Error handling considerations not shown\\n}\\n\\nThese schemes are difficult with CUDA graphs because of the non-fixed pointer or handle for the\\nresource which requires indirection or graph update, and the synchronous CPU code needed each time\\nthe work is submitted. They also do not work with stream capture if these considerations are hidden\\nfrom the caller of the library, and because of use of disallowed APIs during capture. Various solutions\\nexist such as exposing the resource to the caller. CUDA user objects present another approach.\\n\\nA CUDA user object associates a user-specified destructor callbackwith an internal refcount, similar to\\nC++ shared_ptr. References may be owned by user code on the CPU and by CUDA graphs. Note that\\nfor user-owned references, unlike C++ smart pointers, there is no object representing the reference;\\nusers must track user-owned references manually. A typical use case would be to immediately move\\nthe sole user-owned reference to a CUDA graph after the user object is created.\\n\\n60 Chapter 6.

A cloned cudaGraph_t retains a copy of every reference owned by the source cudaGraph_t,\\nwith the same multiplicity. An instantiated cudaGraphExec_t retains a copy of every reference in\\nthe source cudaGraph_t. When a cudaGraphExec_t is destroyed without being synchronized, the\\nreferences are retained until the execution is completed.\\n\\nHere is an example use.\\n\\ncudaGraph_t graph; ∕∕ Preexisting graph\\n\\nObject *object = new Object; ∕∕ C++ object with possibly nontrivial destructor\\ncudaUserObject_t cuObject;\\ncudaUserObjectCreate(\\n\\n&cuObject,\\nobject, ∕∕ Here we use a CUDA-provided template wrapper for this API,\\n\\n∕∕ which supplies a callback to delete the C++ object pointer\\n1, ∕∕ Initial refcount\\ncudaUserObjectNoDestructorSync ∕∕ Acknowledge that the callback cannot be\\n\\n∕∕ waited on via CUDA\\n);\\ncudaGraphRetainUserObject(\\n\\ngraph,\\ncuObject,\\n1, ∕∕ Number of references\\ncudaGraphUserObjectMove ∕∕ Transfer a reference owned by the caller (do\\n\\n∕∕ not modify the total reference count)\\n);\\n∕∕ No more references owned by this thread; no need to call release API\\ncudaGraphExec_t graphExec;\\ncudaGraphInstantiate(&graphExec, graph, nullptr, nullptr, 0); ∕∕ Will retain a\\n\\n∕∕ new reference\\ncudaGraphDestroy(graph); ∕∕ graphExec still owns a reference\\ncudaGraphLaunch(graphExec, 0); ∕∕ Async launch has access to the user objects\\ncudaGraphExecDestroy(graphExec); ∕∕ Launch is not synchronized; the release\\n\\n∕∕ will be deferred if needed\\ncudaStreamSynchronize(0); ∕∕ After the launch is synchronized, the remaining\\n\\n∕∕ reference is released and the destructor will\\n∕∕ execute.

If\\na child graph is updated or deleted, the references change accordingly. If an executable graph or child\\ngraph is updated with cudaGraphExecUpdate or cudaGraphExecChildGraphNodeSetParams, the\\nreferences in the new source graph are cloned and replace the references in the target graph. In either\\ncase, if previous launches are not synchronized, any references which would be released are held until\\nthe launches have finished executing.\\n\\nThere is not currently amechanism to wait on user object destructors via a CUDAAPI. Usersmay signal\\na synchronization object manually from the destructor code. In addition, it is not legal to call CUDA\\nAPIs from the destructor, similar to the restriction on cudaLaunchHostFunc. This is to avoid blocking\\na CUDA internal shared thread and preventing forward progress. It is legal to signal another thread to\\nperform an API call, if the dependency is one way and the thread doing the call cannot block forward\\nprogress of CUDA work.\\n\\nUser objects are created with cudaUserObjectCreate, which is a good starting point to browse re-\\nlated APIs.\\n\\n6.2. CUDA Runtime 61\\n\\n\\n\\nCUDA C++ Programming Guide, Release 12.4\\n\\n6.2.8.7.5 Updating Instantiated Graphs\\n\\nWork submission using graphs is separated into three distinct stages: definition, instantiation, and ex-\\necution. In situations where the workflow is not changing, the overhead of definition and instantiation\\ncan be amortized over many executions, and graphs provide a clear advantage over streams.\\n\\nA graph is a snapshot of aworkflow, including kernels, parameters, and dependencies, in order to replay\\nit as rapidly and efficiently as possible. In situations where the workflow changes the graph becomes\\nout of date and must be modified. Major changes to graph structure such as topology or types of\\nnodes will require re-instantiation of the source graph because various topology-related optimization\\ntechniques must be re-applied.\\n\\nThe cost of repeated instantiation can reduce the overall performance benefit from graph execution,\\nbut it is common for only node parameters, such as kernel parameters and cudaMemcpy addresses,\\nto change while graph topology remains the same. For this case, CUDA provides a lightweight mecha-\\nnism known as “Graph Update,” which allows certain node parameters to be modified in-place without\\nhaving to rebuild the entire graph. This is much more efficient than re-instantiation.\\n\\nUpdates will take effect the next time the graph is launched, so they will not impact previous graph\\nlaunches, even if they are running at the time of the update. A graph may be updated and relaunched\\nrepeatedly, so multiple updates/launches can be queued on a stream.\\n\\nCUDA provides twomechanisms for updating instantiated graph parameters, whole graph update and\\nindividual node update. Whole graph update allows the user to supply a topologically identical cud-\\naGraph_t object whose nodes contain updated parameters. Individual node update allows the user\\nto explicitly update the parameters of individual nodes. Using an updated cudaGraph_t is more con-\\nvenient when a large number of nodes are being updated, or when the graph topology is unknown to\\nthe caller (i.e., The graph resulted from stream capture of a library call). Using individual node update\\nis preferred when the number of changes is small and the user has the handles to the nodes requiring\\nupdates. Individual node update skips the topology checks and comparisons for unchanged nodes, so\\nit can be more efficient in many cases.\\n\\nCUDA also provides a mechanism for enabling and disabling individual nodes without affecting their\\ncurrent parameters.\\n\\nThe following sections explain each approach in more detail.\\n\\n6.2.8.7.5.1 Graph Update Limitations\\n\\nKernel nodes:\\n\\n▶ The owning context of the function cannot change.\\n\\n▶ A node whose function originally did not use CUDA dynamic parallelism cannot be updated to a\\nfunction which uses CUDA dynamic parallelism.\\n\\ncudaMemset and cudaMemcpy nodes:\\n\\n▶ The CUDA device(s) to which the operand(s) was allocated/mapped cannot change.\\n\\n▶ The source/destination memory must be allocated from the same context as the original\\nsource/destination memory.\\n\\n▶ Only 1D cudaMemset/cudaMemcpy nodes can be changed.\\n\\nAdditional memcpy node restrictions:\\n\\n▶ Changing either the source or destination memory type (i.e., cudaPitchedPtr, cudaArray_t,\\netc.), or the type of transfer (i.e., cudaMemcpyKind) is not supported.\\n\\n62 Chapter 6.

The topology of the updating\\ngraph must be identical to the original graph used to instantiate the cudaGraphExec_t. In addition,\\nthe order in which the dependencies are specified must match. Finally, CUDA needs to consistently\\norder the sink nodes (nodes with no dependencies). CUDA relies on the order of specific api calls to\\nachieve consistent sink node ordering.\\n\\nMore explicitly, following the following rules will cause cudaGraphExecUpdate() to pair the nodes in\\nthe original graph and the updating graph deterministically:\\n\\n1. For any capturing stream, the API calls operating on that streammust bemade in the same order,\\nincluding event wait and other api calls not directly corresponding to node creation.\\n\\n2. The API calls which directly manipulate a given graph node’s incoming edges (including captured\\nstream APIs, node add APIs, and edge addition / removal APIs) must be made in the same or-\\nder. Moreover, when dependencies are specified in arrays to these APIs, the order in which the\\ndependencies are specified inside those arrays must match.\\n\\n3. Sink nodes must be consistently ordered. Sink nodes are nodes without dependent nodes / out-\\ngoing edges in the final graph at the time of the cudaGraphExecUpdate() invocation. The fol-\\nlowing operations affect sink node ordering (if present) and must (as a combined set) be made\\nin the same order:\\n\\n▶ Node add APIs resulting in a sink node.\\n\\n▶ Edge removal resulting in a node becoming a sink node.\\n\\n▶ cudaStreamUpdateCaptureDependencies(), if it removes a sink node from a capturing\\nstream’s dependency set.\\n\\n▶ cudaStreamEndCapture().\\n\\nThe following example shows how the API could be used to update an instantiated graph:\\n\\ncudaGraphExec_t graphExec = NULL;\\n\\nfor (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {\\ncudaGraph_t graph;\\ncudaGraphExecUpdateResult updateResult;\\ncudaGraphNode_t errorNode;\\n\\n∕∕ In this example we use stream capture to create the graph.\\n∕∕ You can also use the Graph API to produce a graph.\\n\\n(continues on next page)\\n\\n6.2.

After the initial launch, a new cud-\\naGraph_t is created using the same method as the initial graph and cudaGraphExecUpdate() is\\ncalled. If the graph update is successful, indicated by the updateResult parameter in the above\\nexample, the updated cudaGraphExec_t is launched. If the update fails for any reason, the cud-\\naGraphExecDestroy() and cudaGraphInstantiate() are called to destroy the original cuda-\\nGraphExec_t and instantiate a new one.\\n\\nIt is also possible to update the cudaGraph_t nodes directly (i.e., Using cudaGraphKernelNodeSet-\\nParams()) and subsequently update the cudaGraphExec_t, however it is more efficient to use the\\nexplicit node update APIs covered in the next section.\\n\\nConditional handle flags and default values are updated as part of the graph update.\\n\\nPlease see the Graph API for more information on usage and current limitations.\\n\\n64 Chapter 6.

Rather than offloading this decision-making pro-\\ncess to the host, which may require a round-trip from the device, users may prefer to perform it on\\nthe device. To that end, CUDA provides a mechanism to launch graphs from the device.\\n\\nDevice graph launch provides a convenient way to perform dynamic control flow from the device, be\\nit something as simple as a loop or as complex as a device-side work scheduler. This functionality is\\nonly available on systems which support unified addressing.\\n\\nGraphs which can be launched from the device will henceforth be referred to as device graphs, and\\ngraphs which cannot be launched from the device will be referred to as host graphs.\\n\\nDevice graphs can be launched from both the host and device, whereas host graphs can only be\\nlaunched from the host. Unlike host launches, launching a device graph from the device while a previ-\\nous launch of the graph is running will result in an error, returning cudaErrorInvalidValue; there-\\nfore, a device graph cannot be launched twice from the device at the same time. Launching a device\\ngraph from the host and device simultaneously will result in undefined behavior.\\n\\n6.2.8.7.7.1 Device Graph Creation\\n\\nIn order for a graph to be launched from the device, it must be instantiated explicitly for device\\nlaunch. This is achieved by passing the cudaGraphInstantiateFlagDeviceLaunchflag to the cud-\\naGraphInstantiate() call. As is the case for host graphs, device graph structure is fixed at time\\nof instantiation and cannot be updated without re-instantiation, and instantiation can only be per-\\nformed on the host. In order for a graph to be able to be instantiated for device launch, it must adhere\\nto various requirements.\\n\\n6.2.8.7.7.2 Device Graph Requirements\\n\\nGeneral requirements:\\n\\n▶ The graph’s nodes must all reside on a single device.\\n\\n▶ The graph can only contain kernel nodes, memcpy nodes, memset nodes, and child graph nodes.\\n\\nKernel nodes:\\n\\n▶ Use of CUDA Dynamic Parallelism by kernels in the graph is not permitted.\\n\\n▶ Cooperative launches are permitted so long as MPS is not in use.\\n\\nMemcpy nodes:\\n\\n▶ Only copies involving device memory and/or pinned device-mapped host memory are permitted.\\n\\n▶ Copies involving CUDA arrays are not permitted.\\n\\n▶ Both operands must be accessible from the current device at time of instantiation. Note that\\nthe copy operation will be performed from the device on which the graph resides, even if it is\\ntargeting memory on another device.\\n\\n66 Chapter 6.

This can be achieved in one of two ways.\\n\\nFirstly, the graph can be uploaded explicitly, either via cudaGraphUpload() or by requesting an upload\\nas part of instantiation via cudaGraphInstantiateWithParams().\\n\\nAlternatively, the graph can first be launched from the host, which will perform this upload step im-\\nplicitly as part of the launch.\\n\\nExamples of all three methods can be seen below:\\n\\n∕∕ Explicit upload after instantiation\\ncudaGraphInstantiate(&deviceGraphExec1, deviceGraph1,�\\n↪→cudaGraphInstantiateFlagDeviceLaunch);\\ncudaGraphUpload(deviceGraphExec1, stream);\\n\\n∕∕ Explicit upload as part of instantiation\\ncudaGraphInstantiateParams instantiateParams = {0};\\ninstantiateParams.flags = cudaGraphInstantiateFlagDeviceLaunch |�\\n↪→cudaGraphInstantiateFlagUpload;\\ninstantiateParams.uploadStream = stream;\\ncudaGraphInstantiateWithParams(&deviceGraphExec2, deviceGraph2, &instantiateParams);\\n\\n∕∕ Implicit upload via host launch\\ncudaGraphInstantiate(&deviceGraphExec3, deviceGraph3,�\\n↪→cudaGraphInstantiateFlagDeviceLaunch);\\ncudaGraphLaunch(deviceGraphExec3, stream);\\n\\n6.2.8.7.7.4 Device Graph Update\\n\\nDevice graphs can only be updated from the host, and must be re-uploaded to the device upon exe-\\ncutable graph update in order for the changes to take effect. This can be achieved using the same\\nmethods outlined in the previous section. Unlike host graphs, launching a device graph from the device\\nwhile an update is being applied will result in undefined behavior.\\n\\n6.2.8.7.7.5 Device Launch\\n\\nDevice graphs can be launched from both the host and the device via cudaGraphLaunch(), which\\nhas the same signature on the device as on the host. Device graphs are launched via the same handle\\non the host and the device. Device graphs must be launched from another graph when launched from\\nthe device.\\n\\nDevice-side graph launch is per-thread and multiple launches may occur from different threads at the\\nsame time, so the user will need to select a single thread from which to launch a given graph.\\n\\n6.2. CUDA Runtime 67\\n\\n\\n\\nCUDA C++ Programming Guide, Release 12.4\\n\\n6.2.8.7.7.6 Device Launch Modes\\n\\nUnlike host launch, device graphs cannot be launched into regular CUDA streams, and can only be\\nlaunched into distinct named streams, which each denote a specific launch mode:\\n\\nTable 2: Device-only Graph Launch Streams\\n\\nStream Launch Mode\\n\\ncudaStreamGraphFireAndForget Fire and forget launch\\n\\ncudaStreamGraphTailLaunch Tail launch\\n\\ncudaStreamGraphFireAndForgetAsSibling Sibling launch\\n\\n6.2.8.7.7.7 Fire and Forget Launch\\n\\nAs the name suggests, a fire and forget launch is submitted to the GPU immediately, and it runs in-\\ndependently of the launching graph. In a fire-and-forget scenario, the launching graph is the parent,\\nand the launched graph is the child.\\n\\nFigure 15: Fire and forget launch\\n\\nThe above diagram can be generated by the sample code below:\\n\\n__global__ void launchFireAndForgetGraph(cudaGraphExec_t graph) {\\ncudaGraphLaunch(graph, cudaStreamGraphFireAndForget);\\n\\n}\\n\\nvoid graphSetup() {\\ncudaGraphExec_t gExec1, gExec2;\\ncudaGraph_t g1, g2;\\n\\n∕∕ Create, instantiate, and upload the device graph.\\n(continues on next page)\\n\\n68 Chapter 6.

This total\\nresets between launches of the same parent graph.\\n\\n6.2.8.7.7.8 Graph Execution Environments\\n\\nIn order to fully understand the device-side synchronization model, it is first necessary to understand\\nthe concept of an execution environment.\\n\\nWhen a graph is launched from the device, it is launched into its own execution environment. The\\nexecution environment of a given graph encapsulates all work in the graph as well as all generated fire\\nand forget work. The graph can be considered complete when it has completed execution and when\\nall generated child work is complete.\\n\\nThe below diagram shows the environment encapsulation that would be generated by the fire-and-\\nforget sample code in the previous section.\\n\\nThese environments are also hierarchical, so a graph environment can include multiple levels of child-\\nenvironments from fire and forget launches.\\n\\nWhen a graph is launched from the host, there exists a stream environment that parents the execution\\nenvironment of the launched graph. The stream environment encapsulates all work generated as part\\nof the overall launch. The stream launch is complete (i.e. downstream dependent work may now run)\\nwhen the overall stream environment is marked as complete.\\n\\n6.2.8.7.7.9 Tail Launch\\n\\nUnlike on the host, it is not possible to synchronize with device graphs from the GPU via traditional\\nmethods such as cudaDeviceSynchronize() or cudaStreamSynchronize(). Rather, in order to\\nenable serial work dependencies, a different launch mode - tail launch - is offered, to provide similar\\nfunctionality.\\n\\nA tail launch executes when a graph’s environment is considered complete - ie, when the graph and\\nall its children are complete. When a graph completes, the environment of the next graph in the tail\\nlaunch list will replace the completed environment as a child of the parent environment. Like fire-and-\\nforget launches, a graph can have multiple graphs enqueued for tail launch.\\n\\nThe above execution flow can be generated by the code below:\\n\\n__global__ void launchTailGraph(cudaGraphExec_t graph) {\\ncudaGraphLaunch(graph, cudaStreamGraphTailLaunch);\\n\\n(continues on next page)\\n\\n6.2.

So the first enqueued graph will run first, and then the second, and so on.\\n\\nTail launches enqueued by a tail graph will execute before tail launches enqueued by previous graphs\\nin the tail launch list. These new tail launches will execute in the order they are enqueued.\\n\\nA graph can have up to 255 pending tail launches.\\n\\n72 Chapter 6.

In order to query the currently running device graph so that it can\\nbe relaunched, a new device-side function is added:\\n\\ncudaGraphExec_t cudaGetCurrentGraphExec();\\n\\nThis function returns the handle of the currently running graph if it is a device graph. If the currently\\nexecuting kernel is not a node within a device graph, this function will return NULL.\\n\\nBelow is sample code showing usage of this function for a relaunch loop:\\n\\n__device__ int relaunchCount = 0;\\n\\n__global__ void relaunchSelf() {\\nint relaunchMax = 100;\\n\\nif (threadIdx.x == 0) {\\nif (relaunchCount < relaunchMax) {\\n\\ncudaGraphLaunch(cudaGetCurrentGraphExec(), cudaStreamGraphTailLaunch);\\n}\\n\\nrelaunchCount++;\\n}\\n\\n}\\n\\n6.2. CUDA Runtime 73\\n\\n\\n\\nCUDA C++ Programming Guide, Release 12.4\\n\\n6.2.8.7.7.11 Sibling Launch\\n\\nSibling launch is a variation of fire-and-forget launch in which the graph is launched not as a child\\nof the launching graph’s execution environment, but rather as a child of the launching graph’s parent\\nenvironment. Sibling launch is equivalent to a fire-and-forget launch from the launching graph’s parent\\nenvironment.\\n\\nFigure 22: A simple sibling launch\\n\\nThe above diagram can be generated by the sample code below:\\n\\n__global__ void launchSiblingGraph(cudaGraphExec_t graph) {\\ncudaGraphLaunch(graph, cudaStreamGraphFireAndForgetAsSibling);\\n\\n}\\n\\nvoid graphSetup() {\\ncudaGraphExec_t gExec1, gExec2;\\ncudaGraph_t g1, g2;\\n\\n∕∕ Create, instantiate, and upload the device graph.\\ncreate_graph(&g2);\\ncudaGraphInstantiate(&gExec2, g2, cudaGraphInstantiateFlagDeviceLaunch);\\ncudaGraphUpload(gExec2, stream);\\n\\n(continues on next page)\\n\\n74 Chapter 6.

This allows dynamic and iterative workflows to be represented completely within a graph and\\nfrees up the host CPU to perform other work in parallel.\\n\\nEvaluation of the condition value is performed on the device when the dependencies of the conditional\\nnode have been met. Conditional nodes can be one of the following types:\\n\\n▶ Conditional IF nodes execute their body graph once if the condition value is non-zero when the\\nnode is executed.\\n\\n▶ Conditional WHILE nodes execute their body graph if the condition value is non-zero when the\\nnode is executed and will continue to execute their body graph until the condition value is zero.\\n\\nA condition value is accessed by a conditional handle , which must be created before the node. The\\ncondition value can be set by device code using cudaGraphSetConditional(). A default value, ap-\\nplied on each graph launch, can also be specified when the handle is created.\\n\\nWhen the conditional node is created, an empty graph is created and the handle is returned to the\\nuser so that the graph can be populated. This conditional body graph can be populated using either\\nthe graph APIs or cudaStreamBeginCaptureToGraph() .\\n\\nConditional nodes can be nested.\\n\\n6.2.8.7.8.1 Conditional Handles\\n\\nA condition value is represented by cudaGraphConditionalHandle and is created by cudaGraph-\\nConditionalHandleCreate().\\n\\nThe handle must be associated with a single conditional node. Handles cannot be destroyed.\\n\\nIf cudaGraphCondAssignDefault is specified when the handle is created, the condition value will be\\ninitialized to the specified default before every graph launch. If this flag is not provided, it is up to the\\nuser to initialize the condition value in a kernel upstream of the conditional node which tests it. If the\\ncondition value is not initialized by one of these methods, its value is undefined.\\n\\nThe default value and flags associated with a handle will be updated during whole graph update .\\n\\n6.2.

Events in stream zero are completed after all\\npreceding tasks and commands in all streams are completed.\\n\\n6.2.8.8.1 Creation and Destruction of Events\\n\\nThe following code sample creates two events:\\n\\ncudaEvent_t start, stop;\\ncudaEventCreate(&start);\\ncudaEventCreate(&stop);\\n\\nThey are destroyed this way:\\n\\ncudaEventDestroy(start);\\ncudaEventDestroy(stop);\\n\\n6.2.8.8.2 Elapsed Time\\n\\nThe events created in Creation and Destruction can be used to time the code sample of Creation and\\nDestruction the following way:\\n\\ncudaEventRecord(start, 0);\\nfor (int i = 0; i < 2; ++i) {\\n\\ncudaMemcpyAsync(inputDev + i * size, inputHost + i * size,\\nsize, cudaMemcpyHostToDevice, stream[i]);\\n\\nMyKernel<<<100, 512, 0, stream[i]>>>\\n(outputDev + i * size, inputDev + i * size, size);\\n\\ncudaMemcpyAsync(outputHost + i * size, outputDev + i * size,\\nsize, cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost, stream[i]);\\n\\n}\\ncudaEventRecord(stop, 0);\\ncudaEventSynchronize(stop);\\nfloat elapsedTime;\\ncudaEventElapsedTime(&elapsedTime, start, stop);\\n\\n6.2.8.9 Synchronous Calls\\n\\nWhen a synchronous function is called, control is not returned to the host thread before the device has\\ncompleted the requested task. Whether the host thread will then yield, block, or spin can be specified\\nby calling cudaSetDeviceFlags()with some specific flags (see reference manual for details) before\\nany other CUDA call is performed by the host thread.\\n\\n6.2.

Multi-Device System\\n\\n6.2.9.1 Device Enumeration\\n\\nA host system can have multiple devices. The following code sample shows how to enumerate these\\ndevices, query their properties, and determine the number of CUDA-enabled devices.\\n\\nint deviceCount;\\ncudaGetDeviceCount(&deviceCount);\\nint device;\\nfor (device = 0; device < deviceCount; ++device) {\\n\\ncudaDeviceProp deviceProp;\\ncudaGetDeviceProperties(&deviceProp, device);\\nprintf(\"Device %d has compute capability %d.%d.\\\\n\",\\n\\ndevice, deviceProp.major, deviceProp.minor);\\n}\\n\\n6.2.9.2 Device Selection\\n\\nA host thread can set the device it operates on at any time by calling cudaSetDevice(). Device\\nmemory allocations and kernel launches are made on the currently set device; streams and events\\nare created in association with the currently set device. If no call to cudaSetDevice() is made, the\\ncurrent device is device 0.\\n\\nThe following code sample illustrates how setting the current device affects memory allocation and\\nkernel execution.\\n\\nsize_t size = 1024 * sizeof(float);\\ncudaSetDevice(0); ∕∕ Set device 0 as current\\nfloat* p0;\\ncudaMalloc(&p0, size); ∕∕ Allocate memory on device 0\\nMyKernel<<<1000, 128>>>(p0); ∕∕ Launch kernel on device 0\\ncudaSetDevice(1); ∕∕ Set device 1 as current\\nfloat* p1;\\ncudaMalloc(&p1, size); ∕∕ Allocate memory on device 1\\nMyKernel<<<1000, 128>>>(p1); ∕∕ Launch kernel on device 1\\n\\n6.2.9.3 Stream and Event Behavior\\n\\nA kernel launch will fail if it is issued to a stream that is not associated to the current device as illus-\\ntrated in the following code sample.\\n\\ncudaSetDevice(0); ∕∕ Set device 0 as current\\ncudaStream_t s0;\\ncudaStreamCreate(&s0); ∕∕ Create stream s0 on device 0\\nMyKernel<<<100, 64, 0, s0>>>(); ∕∕ Launch kernel on device 0 in s0\\ncudaSetDevice(1); ∕∕ Set device 1 as current\\ncudaStream_t s1;\\ncudaStreamCreate(&s1); ∕∕ Create stream s1 on device 1\\nMyKernel<<<100, 64, 0, s1>>>(); ∕∕ Launch kernel on device 1 in s1\\n\\n∕∕ This kernel launch will fail:\\nMyKernel<<<100, 64, 0, s0>>>(); ∕∕ Launch kernel on device 1 in s0\\n\\n80 Chapter 6. Programming Interface\\n\\n\\n\\nCUDA C++ Programming Guide, Release 12.4\\n\\nAmemory copy will succeed even if it is issued to a stream that is not associated to the current device.\\n\\ncudaEventRecord() will fail if the input event and input stream are associated to different devices.\\n\\ncudaEventElapsedTime() will fail if the two input events are associated to different devices.\\n\\ncudaEventSynchronize() and cudaEventQuery() will succeed even if the input event is associ-\\nated to a device that is different from the current device.\\n\\ncudaStreamWaitEvent() will succeed even if the input stream and input event are associated to\\ndifferent devices. cudaStreamWaitEvent() can therefore be used to synchronize multiple devices\\nwith each other.\\n\\nEach device has its own default stream (see Default Stream), so commands issued to the default\\nstream of a device may execute out of order or concurrently with respect to commands issued to\\nthe default stream of any other device.\\n\\n6.2.9.4 Peer-to-Peer Memory Access\\n\\nDepending on the system properties, specifically the PCIe and/or NVLINK topology, devices are able\\nto address each other’s memory (i.e., a kernel executing on one device can dereference a pointer to\\nthe memory of the other device). This peer-to-peer memory access feature is supported between two\\ndevices if cudaDeviceCanAccessPeer() returns true for these two devices.\\n\\nPeer-to-peer memory access is only supported in 64-bit applications and must be enabled between\\ntwo devices by calling cudaDeviceEnablePeerAccess() as illustrated in the following code sample.\\nOn non-NVSwitch enabled systems, each device can support a system-wide maximum of eight peer\\nconnections.\\n\\nA unified address space is used for both devices (see Unified Virtual Address Space), so the same\\npointer can be used to address memory from both devices as shown in the code sample below.\\n\\ncudaSetDevice(0); ∕∕ Set device 0 as current\\nfloat* p0;\\nsize_t size = 1024 * sizeof(float);\\ncudaMalloc(&p0, size); ∕∕ Allocate memory on device 0\\nMyKernel<<<1000, 128>>>(p0); ∕∕ Launch kernel on device 0\\ncudaSetDevice(1); ∕∕ Set device 1 as current\\ncudaDeviceEnablePeerAccess(0, 0); ∕∕ Enable peer-to-peer access\\n\\n∕∕ with device 0\\n\\n∕∕ Launch kernel on device 1\\n∕∕ This kernel launch can access memory on device 0 at address p0\\nMyKernel<<<1000, 128>>>(p0);\\n\\n6.2.9.4.1 IOMMU on Linux\\n\\nOn Linux only, CUDA and the display driver does not support IOMMU-enabled bare-metal PCIe peer to\\npeer memory copy. However, CUDA and the display driver does support IOMMU via VM pass through.\\nAs a consequence, users on Linux, when running on a native bare metal system, should disable the\\nIOMMU. The IOMMU should be enabled and the VFIO driver be used as a PCIe pass through for virtual\\nmachines.\\n\\nOn Windows the above limitation does not exist.\\n\\nSee also Allocating DMA Buffers on 64-bit Platforms.\\n\\n6.2.

Unified Virtual Address Space\\n\\nWhen the application is run as a 64-bit process, a single address space is used for the host and all the\\ndevices of compute capability 2.0 and higher. All host memory allocations made via CUDA API calls\\nand all device memory allocations on supported devices are within this virtual address range. As a\\nconsequence:\\n\\n▶ The location of any memory on the host allocated through CUDA, or on any of the devices which\\nuse the unified address space, can be determined from the value of the pointer using cuda-\\nPointerGetAttributes().\\n\\n▶ When copying to or from the memory of any device which uses the unified address space, the\\ncudaMemcpyKind parameter of cudaMemcpy*() can be set to cudaMemcpyDefault to deter-\\nmine locations from the pointers. This also works for host pointers not allocated through CUDA,\\nas long as the current device uses unified addressing.\\n\\n▶ Allocations via cudaHostAlloc() are automatically portable (see Portable Memory) across all\\nthe devices for which the unified address space is used, and pointers returned by cudaHostAl-\\nloc() can be used directly from within kernels running on these devices (i.e., there is no need to\\nobtain a device pointer via cudaHostGetDevicePointer() as described in Mapped Memory.\\n\\n82 Chapter 6.

Interprocess Communication\\n\\nAny device memory pointer or event handle created by a host thread can be directly referenced by\\nany other thread within the same process. It is not valid outside this process however, and therefore\\ncannot be directly referenced by threads belonging to a different process.\\n\\nTo share device memory pointers and events across processes, an application must use the Inter Pro-\\ncess Communication API, which is described in detail in the reference manual. The IPC API is only\\nsupported for 64-bit processes on Linux and for devices of compute capability 2.0 and higher. Note\\nthat the IPC API is not supported for cudaMallocManaged allocations.\\n\\nUsing this API, an application can get the IPC handle for a given device memory pointer using cud-\\naIpcGetMemHandle(), pass it to another process using standard IPC mechanisms (for example, in-\\nterprocess shared memory or files), and use cudaIpcOpenMemHandle() to retrieve a device pointer\\nfrom the IPC handle that is a valid pointer within this other process. Event handles can be shared using\\nsimilar entry points.\\n\\nNote that allocationsmade by cudaMalloc()may be sub-allocated from a larger block ofmemory for\\nperformance reasons. In such case, CUDA IPCAPIswill share the entire underlyingmemory blockwhich\\nmay cause other sub-allocations to be shared, which can potentially lead to information disclosure\\nbetween processes. To prevent this behavior, it is recommended to only share allocations with a 2MiB\\naligned size.\\n\\nAn example of using the IPC API is where a single primary process generates a batch of input data,\\nmaking the data available to multiple secondary processes without requiring regeneration or copying.\\n\\nApplications using CUDA IPC to communicate with each other should be compiled, linked, and run with\\nthe same CUDA driver and runtime.\\n\\nNote: Since CUDA11.5, only events-sharing IPCAPIs are supported on L4T and embedded Linux Tegra\\ndevices with compute capability 7.x and higher. The memory-sharing IPC APIs are still not supported\\non Tegra platforms.\\n\\n6.2.12. Error Checking\\n\\nAll runtime functions return an error code, but for an asynchronous function (see Asynchronous Con-\\ncurrent Execution), this error code cannot possibly report any of the asynchronous errors that could\\noccur on the device since the function returns before the device has completed the task; the error\\ncode only reports errors that occur on the host prior to executing the task, typically related to pa-\\nrameter validation; if an asynchronous error occurs, it will be reported by some subsequent unrelated\\nruntime function call.\\n\\nThe only way to check for asynchronous errors just after some asynchronous function call is therefore\\nto synchronize just after the call by calling cudaDeviceSynchronize() (or by using any other syn-\\nchronization mechanisms described in Asynchronous Concurrent Execution) and checking the error\\ncode returned by cudaDeviceSynchronize().\\n\\nThe runtime maintains an error variable for each host thread that is initialized to cudaSuccess and\\nis overwritten by the error code every time an error occurs (be it a parameter validation error or an\\n\\n6.2. CUDA Runtime 83\\n\\nindex.html#device-enumeration\\nindex.html#asynchronous-concurrent-execution\\nindex.html#asynchronous-concurrent-execution\\nindex.html#asynchronous-concurrent-execution\\n\\n\\nCUDA C++ Programming Guide, Release 12.4\\n\\nasynchronous error). cudaPeekAtLastError() returns this variable. cudaGetLastError() returns\\nthis variable and resets it to cudaSuccess.\\n\\nKernel launches do not return any error code, so cudaPeekAtLastError() or cudaGetLastError()\\nmust be called just after the kernel launch to retrieve any pre-launch errors. To ensure that any error\\nreturned by cudaPeekAtLastError() or cudaGetLastError() does not originate from calls prior\\nto the kernel launch, one has to make sure that the runtime error variable is set to cudaSuccess just\\nbefore the kernel launch, for example, by calling cudaGetLastError() just before the kernel launch.\\nKernel launches are asynchronous, so to check for asynchronous errors, the application must syn-\\nchronize in-between the kernel launch and the call to cudaPeekAtLastError() or cudaGetLastEr-\\nror().\\n\\nNote that cudaErrorNotReady that may be returned by cudaStreamQuery() and cudaEvent-\\nQuery() is not considered an error and is therefore not reported by cudaPeekAtLastError() or\\ncudaGetLastError().\\n\\n6.2.13. Call Stack\\n\\nOn devices of compute capability 2.x and higher, the size of the call stack can be queried us-\\ningcudaDeviceGetLimit() and set using cudaDeviceSetLimit().\\n\\nWhen the call stack overflows, the kernel call fails with a stack overflow error if the application is run via\\na CUDA debugger (CUDA-GDB, Nsight) or an unspecified launch error, otherwise. When the compiler\\ncannot determine the stack size, it issues a warning saying Stack size cannot be statically determined.\\nThis is usually the case with recursive functions. Once this warning is issued, user will need to set stack\\nsize manually if default stack size is not sufficient.\\n\\n6.2.14. Texture and Surface Memory\\n\\nCUDA supports a subset of the texturing hardware that the GPU uses for graphics to access texture\\nand surface memory. Reading data from texture or surface memory instead of global memory can\\nhave several performance benefits as described in Device Memory Accesses.\\n\\n6.2.14.1 Texture Memory\\n\\nTexture memory is read from kernels using the device functions described in Texture Functions. The\\nprocess of reading a texture calling one of these functions is called a texture fetch. Each texture fetch\\nspecifies a parameter called a texture object for the texture object API.\\n\\nThe texture object specifies:\\n\\n▶ The texture, which is the piece of texture memory that is fetched. Texture objects are created\\nat runtime and the texture is specified when creating the texture object as described in Texture\\nObject API.\\n\\n▶ Its dimensionality that specifies whether the texture is addressed as a one dimensional array\\nusing one texture coordinate, a two-dimensional array using two texture coordinates, or a three-\\ndimensional array using three texture coordinates. Elements of the array are called texels, short\\nfor texture elements. The texture width, height, and depth refer to the size of the array in each\\ndimension. Table 21 lists the maximum texture width, height, and depth depending on the com-\\npute capability of the device.\\n\\n84 Chapter 6. Programming Interface\\n\\nindex.html#device-memory-accesses\\nindex.html#texture-functions\\nindex.html#texture-object-api\\nindex.html#texture-object-api\\nindex.html#features-and-technical-specifications-technical-specifications-per-compute-capability\\n\\n\\nCUDA C++ Programming Guide, Release 12.4\\n\\n▶ The type of a texel, which is restricted to the basic integer and single-precision floating-point\\ntypes and any of the 1-, 2-, and 4-component vector types defined in Built-in Vector Types that\\nare derived from the basic integer and single-precision floating-point types.\\n\\n▶ The readmode, which is equal to cudaReadModeNormalizedFloat or cudaReadModeElement-\\nType. If it is cudaReadModeNormalizedFloat and the type of the texel is a 16-bit or 8-bit inte-\\nger type, the value returned by the texture fetch is actually returned as floating-point type and\\nthe full range of the integer type is mapped to [0.0, 1.0] for unsigned integer type and [-1.0, 1.0]\\nfor signed integer type; for example, an unsigned 8-bit texture element with the value 0xff reads\\nas 1. If it is cudaReadModeElementType, no conversion is performed.\\n\\n▶ Whether texture coordinates are normalized or not. By default, textures are referenced (by the\\nfunctions of Texture Functions) using floating-point coordinates in the range [0, N-1] where N\\nis the size of the texture in the dimension corresponding to the coordinate. For example, a tex-\\nture that is 64x32 in size will be referenced with coordinates in the range [0, 63] and [0, 31] for\\nthe x and y dimensions, respectively. Normalized texture coordinates cause the coordinates to\\nbe specified in the range [0.0, 1.0-1/N] instead of [0, N-1], so the same 64x32 texture would be\\naddressed by normalized coordinates in the range [0, 1-1/N] in both the x and y dimensions. Nor-\\nmalized texture coordinates are a natural fit to some applications’ requirements, if it is preferable\\nfor the texture coordinates to be independent of the texture size.\\n\\n▶ The addressing mode. It is valid to call the device functions of Section B.8 with coordinates that\\nare out of range. The addressing mode defines what happens in that case. The default address-\\ning mode is to clamp the coordinates to the valid range: [0, N) for non-normalized coordinates\\nand [0.0, 1.0) for normalized coordinates. If the border mode is specified instead, texture fetches\\nwith out-of-range texture coordinates return zero. For normalized coordinates, the wrap mode\\nand the mirror mode are also available. When using the wrap mode, each coordinate x is con-\\nverted to frac(x)=x - floor(x) where floor(x) is the largest integer not greater than x. When us-\\ning the mirror mode, each coordinate x is converted to frac(x) if floor(x) is even and 1-frac(x) if\\nfloor(x) is odd. The addressing mode is specified as an array of size three whose first, second,\\nand third elements specify the addressing mode for the first, second, and third texture coor-\\ndinates, respectively; the addressing mode are cudaAddressModeBorder, cudaAddressMod-\\neClamp, cudaAddressModeWrap, and cudaAddressModeMirror; cudaAddressModeWrap and\\ncudaAddressModeMirror are only supported for normalized texture coordinates\\n\\n▶ The filtering mode which specifies how the value returned when fetching the texture is com-\\nputed based on the input texture coordinates. Linear texture filtering may be done only for tex-\\ntures that are configured to return floating-point data. It performs low-precision interpolation\\nbetween neighboring texels. When enabled, the texels surrounding a texture fetch location are\\nread and the return value of the texture fetch is interpolated based on where the texture co-\\nordinates fell between the texels. Simple linear interpolation is performed for one-dimensional\\ntextures, bilinear interpolation for two-dimensional textures, and trilinear interpolation for three-\\ndimensional textures. Texture Fetching givesmore details on texture fetching. Thefilteringmode\\nis equal to cudaFilterModePoint or cudaFilterModeLinear. If it is cudaFilterModePoint,\\nthe returned value is the texel whose texture coordinates are the closest to the input texture co-\\nordinates. If it is cudaFilterModeLinear, the returned value is the linear interpolation of the\\ntwo (for a one-dimensional texture), four (for a two dimensional texture), or eight (for a three\\ndimensional texture) texels whose texture coordinates are the closest to the input texture coor-\\ndinates. cudaFilterModeLinear is only valid for returned values of floating-point type.\\n\\nTexture Object API introduces the texture object API.\\n\\n16-Bit Floating-Point Textures explains how to deal with 16-bit floating-point textures.\\n\\nTextures can also be layered as described in Layered Textures.\\n\\nCubemap Textures and Cubemap Layered Textures describe a special type of texture, the cubemap\\ntexture.\\n\\n6.2.

It is per-\\nformed by the tex2Dgather() function, which has the same parameters as tex2D(), plus an addi-\\ntional comp parameter equal to 0, 1, 2, or 3 (see tex2Dgather()). It returns four 32-bit numbers that\\ncorrespond to the value of the component comp of each of the four texels that would have been used\\nfor bilinear filtering during a regular texture fetch. For example, if these texels are of values (253,\\n20, 31, 255), (250, 25, 29, 254), (249, 16, 37, 253), (251, 22, 30, 250), and comp is 2, tex2Dgather()\\nreturns (31, 29, 37, 30).\\n\\nNote that texture coordinates are computed with only 8 bits of fractional precision. tex2Dgather()\\nmay therefore return unexpected results for cases where tex2D()would use 1.0 for one of its weights\\n(� or �, see Linear Filtering). For example, with an x texture coordinate of 2.49805: xB=x-0.5=1.99805,\\nhowever the fractional part of xB is stored in an 8-bit fixed-point format. Since 0.99805 is closer to\\n256.f/256.f than it is to 255.f/256.f, xB has the value 2. A tex2Dgather() in this case would therefore\\nreturn indices 2 and 3 in x, instead of indices 1 and 2.\\n\\nTexture gather is only supported for CUDA arrays created with the cudaArrayTextureGather flag\\nand of width and height less than the maximum specified in Table 21 for texture gather, which is\\nsmaller than for regular texture fetch.\\n\\nTexture gather is only supported on devices of compute capability 2.0 and higher.\\n\\n6.2.14.2 Surface Memory\\n\\nFor devices of compute capability 2.0 and higher, a CUDA array (described in Cubemap Surfaces), cre-\\nated with the cudaArraySurfaceLoadStore flag, can be read and written via a surface object using\\nthe functions described in Surface Functions.\\n\\nTable 21 lists the maximum surface width, height, and depth depending on the compute capability of\\nthe device.\\n\\n6.2.14.2.1 Surface Object API\\n\\nA surface object is created using cudaCreateSurfaceObject() from a resource description of type\\nstruct cudaResourceDesc. Unlike texture memory, surface memory uses byte addressing. This\\nmeans that the x-coordinate used to access a texture element via texture functions needs to be mul-\\ntiplied by the byte size of the element to access the same element via a surface function. For example,\\nthe element at texture coordinate x of a one-dimensional floating-point CUDA array bound to a tex-\\nture object texObj and a surface object surfObj is read using tex1d(texObj, x) via texObj, but\\nsurf1Dread(surfObj, 4*x) via surfObj. Similarly, the element at texture coordinate x and y of\\na two-dimensional floating-point CUDA array bound to a texture object texObj and a surface object\\nsurfObj is accessed using tex2d(texObj, x, y) via texObj, but surf2Dread(surfObj, 4*x,\\ny) via surObj (the byte offset of the y-coordinate is internally calculated from the underlying line\\npitch of the CUDA array).\\n\\nThe following code sample applies some simple transformation kernel to a surface.\\n\\n∕∕ Simple copy kernel\\n__global__ void copyKernel(cudaSurfaceObject_t inputSurfObj,\\n\\ncudaSurfaceObject_t outputSurfObj,\\nint width, int height)\\n\\n{\\n∕∕ Calculate surface coordinates\\n\\n(continues on next page)\\n\\n90 Chapter 6.

In other words, a thread can safely read\\nsome texture or surface memory location only if this memory location has been updated by a previous\\nkernel call or memory copy, but not if it has been previously updated by the same thread or another\\nthread from the same kernel call.\\n\\n6.2.15. Graphics Interoperability\\n\\nSome resources from OpenGL and Direct3D may be mapped into the address space of CUDA, either\\nto enable CUDA to read data written by OpenGL or Direct3D, or to enable CUDA to write data for\\nconsumption by OpenGL or Direct3D.\\n\\nA resource must be registered to CUDA before it can be mapped using the functions mentioned in\\nOpenGL Interoperability and Direct3D Interoperability. These functions return a pointer to a CUDA\\ngraphics resource of type struct cudaGraphicsResource. Registering a resource is potentially\\nhigh-overhead and therefore typically called only once per resource. A CUDA graphics resource is un-\\nregistered using cudaGraphicsUnregisterResource(). Each CUDA context which intends to use\\nthe resource is required to register it separately.\\n\\nOnce a resource is registered to CUDA, it can be mapped and unmapped as many times as necessary\\nusing cudaGraphicsMapResources() and cudaGraphicsUnmapResources(). cudaGraphicsRe-\\nsourceSetMapFlags() can be called to specify usage hints (write-only, read-only) that the CUDA\\ndriver can use to optimize resource management.\\n\\nA mapped resource can be read from or written to by kernels using the device mem-\\nory address returned by cudaGraphicsResourceGetMappedPointer() for buffers\\nandcudaGraphicsSubResourceGetMappedArray() for CUDA arrays.\\n\\nAccessing a resource through OpenGL, Direct3D, or another CUDA context while it is mapped pro-\\nduces undefined results. OpenGL Interoperability and Direct3D Interoperability give specifics for each\\ngraphics API and some code samples. SLI Interoperability gives specifics for when the system is in SLI\\nmode.\\n\\n6.2.15.1 OpenGL Interoperability\\n\\nThe OpenGL resources that may be mapped into the address space of CUDA are OpenGL buffer, tex-\\nture, and renderbuffer objects.\\n\\nA buffer object is registered using cudaGraphicsGLRegisterBuffer(). In CUDA, it appears as a\\ndevice pointer and can therefore be read and written by kernels or via cudaMemcpy() calls.\\n\\nA texture or renderbuffer object is registered using cudaGraphicsGLRegisterImage(). In CUDA, it\\nappears as a CUDA array. Kernels can read from the array by binding it to a texture or surface reference.\\nThey can also write to it via the surface write functions if the resource has been registered with the\\ncudaGraphicsRegisterFlagsSurfaceLoadStore flag. The array can also be read and written via\\ncudaMemcpy2D() calls. cudaGraphicsGLRegisterImage() supports all texture formats with 1, 2,\\nor 4 components and an internal type of float (for example, GL_RGBA_FLOAT32), normalized integer\\n(for example, GL_RGBA8, GL_INTENSITY16), and unnormalized integer (for example, GL_RGBA8UI)\\n(please note that since unnormalized integer formats require OpenGL 3.0, they can only be written by\\nshaders, not the fixed function pipeline).\\n\\n6.2.

There are however special considerations as described below when the system is\\nin SLI mode.\\n\\nFirst, an allocation in one CUDA device on one GPU will consume memory on other GPUs that are part\\nof the SLI configuration of the Direct3D or OpenGL device. Because of this, allocations may fail earlier\\nthan otherwise expected.\\n\\nSecond, applications should create multiple CUDA contexts, one for each GPU in the SLI configura-\\ntion. While this is not a strict requirement, it avoids unnecessary data transfers between devices. The\\napplication can use the cudaD3D[9|10|11]GetDevices() for Direct3D and cudaGLGetDevices()\\nfor OpenGL set of calls to identify the CUDA device handle(s) for the device(s) that are performing the\\nrendering in the current and next frame. Given this information the application will typically choose\\nthe appropriate device and map Direct3D or OpenGL resources to the CUDA device returned by cu-\\ndaD3D[9|10|11]GetDevices() or cudaGLGetDevices() when the deviceList parameter is set\\nto cudaD3D[9|10|11]DeviceListCurrentFrame or cudaGLDeviceListCurrentFrame.\\n\\nPlease note that resource returned from cudaGraphicsD9D[9|10|11]RegisterResource and\\ncudaGraphicsGLRegister[Buffer|Image]must be only used ondevice the registration happened.\\nTherefore on SLI configurations when data for different frames is computed on different CUDA de-\\nvices it is necessary to register the resources for each separately.\\n\\nSee Direct3D Interoperability and OpenGL Interoperability for details on how the CUDA runtime inter-\\noperate with Direct3D and OpenGL, respectively.\\n\\n102 Chapter 6.

External Resource Interoperability\\n\\nExternal resource interoperability allows CUDA to import certain resources that are explicitly exported\\nby other APIs. These objects are typically exported by other APIs using handles native to the Operating\\nSystem, like file descriptors on Linux or NT handles on Windows. They could also be exported using\\nother unified interfaces such as the NVIDIA Software Communication Interface. There are two types\\nof resources that can be imported: memory objects and synchronization objects.\\n\\nMemory objects can be imported into CUDA using cudaImportExternalMemory(). An imported\\nmemory object can be accessed from within kernels using device pointers mapped onto the memory\\nobject via cudaExternalMemoryGetMappedBuffer()or CUDA mipmapped arrays mapped via cud-\\naExternalMemoryGetMappedMipmappedArray(). Depending on the type of memory object, it may\\nbe possible for more than one mapping to be setup on a single memory object. The mappings must\\nmatch the mappings setup in the exporting API. Any mismatched mappings result in undefined be-\\nhavior. Imported memory objects must be freed using cudaDestroyExternalMemory(). Freeing\\na memory object does not free any mappings to that object. Therefore, any device pointers mapped\\nonto that object must be explicitly freed using cudaFree() and any CUDAmipmapped arraysmapped\\nonto that object must be explicitly freed using cudaFreeMipmappedArray(). It is illegal to access\\nmappings to an object after it has been destroyed.\\n\\nSynchronization objects can be imported into CUDA using cudaImportExternalSemaphore(). An\\nimported synchronization object can then be signaled using cudaSignalExternalSemaphore-\\nsAsync() and waited on using cudaWaitExternalSemaphoresAsync(). It is illegal to issue a wait\\nbefore the corresponding signal has been issued. Also, depending on the type of the imported syn-\\nchronization object, there may be additional constraints imposed on how they can be signaled and\\nwaited on, as described in subsequent sections. Imported semaphore objects must be freed using\\ncudaDestroyExternalSemaphore(). All outstanding signals and waits must have completed be-\\nfore the semaphore object is destroyed.\\n\\n6.2.16.1 Vulkan Interoperability\\n\\n6.2.16.1.1 Matching device UUIDs\\n\\nWhen importing memory and synchronization objects exported by Vulkan, they must be imported\\nand mapped on the same device as they were created on. The CUDA device that corresponds to the\\nVulkan physical device on which the objects were created can be determined by comparing the UUID\\nof a CUDA device with that of the Vulkan physical device, as shown in the following code sample. Note\\nthat the Vulkan physical device should not be part of a device group that contains more than one\\nVulkan physical device. The device group as returned by vkEnumeratePhysicalDeviceGroups that\\ncontains the given Vulkan physical device must have a physical device count of 1.\\n\\nint getCudaDeviceForVulkanPhysicalDevice(VkPhysicalDevice vkPhysicalDevice) {\\nVkPhysicalDeviceIDProperties vkPhysicalDeviceIDProperties = {};\\nvkPhysicalDeviceIDProperties.sType = VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_PHYSICAL_DEVICE_ID_\\n\\n↪→PROPERTIES;\\nvkPhysicalDeviceIDProperties.pNext = NULL;\\n\\nVkPhysicalDeviceProperties2 vkPhysicalDeviceProperties2 = {};\\nvkPhysicalDeviceProperties2.sType = VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_PHYSICAL_DEVICE_PROPERTIES_\\n\\n↪→2;\\nvkPhysicalDeviceProperties2.pNext = &vkPhysicalDeviceIDProperties;\\n\\nvkGetPhysicalDeviceProperties2(vkPhysicalDevice, &vkPhysicalDeviceProperties2);\\n(continues on next page)\\n\\n6.2.

Versioning and Compatibility\\n\\nThere are two version numbers that developers should care aboutwhendeveloping aCUDAapplication:\\nThe compute capability that describes the general specifications and features of the compute device\\n(see Compute Capability) and the version of the CUDAdriver API that describes the features supported\\nby the driver API and runtime.\\n\\nThe version of the driver API is defined in the driver header file as CUDA_VERSION. It allows developers\\nto check whether their application requires a newer device driver than the one currently installed.\\nThis is important, because the driver API is backward compatible, meaning that applications, plug-ins,\\nand libraries (including the CUDA runtime) compiled against a particular version of the driver API will\\ncontinue to work on subsequent device driver releases as illustrated in Figure 12. The driver API is\\nnot forward compatible, which means that applications, plug-ins, and libraries (including the CUDA\\nruntime) compiled against a particular version of the driver API will not work on previous versions of\\nthe device driver.\\n\\nIt is important to note that there are limitations on the mixing and matching of versions that is sup-\\nported:\\n\\n▶ Since only one version of the CUDA Driver can be installed at a time on a system, the installed\\ndriver must be of the same or higher version than the maximumDriver API version against which\\nany application, plug-ins, or libraries that must run on that system were built.\\n\\n▶ All plug-ins and libraries used by an application must use the same version of the CUDA Runtime\\nunless they statically link to the Runtime, in which case multiple versions of the runtime can\\ncoexist in the same process space. Note that if nvcc is used to link the application, the static\\nversion of the CUDA Runtime library will be used by default, and all CUDA Toolkit libraries are\\nstatically linked against the CUDA Runtime.\\n\\n132 Chapter 6.

This feature is described in CUDA Compatibility. The require-\\nments on the CUDA Driver version described here apply to the version of the user-mode components.\\n\\n6.4. Compute Modes\\n\\nOn Tesla solutions runningWindows Server 2008 and later or Linux, one can set any device in a system\\nin one of the three following modes using NVIDIA’s SystemManagement Interface (nvidia-smi), which\\nis a tool distributed as part of the driver:\\n\\n▶ Default compute mode: Multiple host threads can use the device (by calling cudaSetDevice()\\non this device, when using the runtime API, or by making current a context associated to the\\ndevice, when using the driver API) at the same time.\\n\\n▶ Exclusive-process compute mode: Only one CUDA context may be created on the device across\\nall processes in the system. The context may be current to as many threads as desired within\\nthe process that created that context.\\n\\n▶ Prohibited compute mode: No CUDA context can be created on the device.\\n\\nThis means, in particular, that a host thread using the runtime API without explicitly calling cudaSet-\\nDevice()might be associatedwith a device other thandevice 0 if device 0 turns out to be in prohibited\\nmode or in exclusive-process mode and used by another process. cudaSetValidDevices() can be\\nused to set a device from a prioritized list of devices.\\n\\nNote also that, for devices featuring the Pascal architecture onwards (compute capability with major\\nrevision number 6 and higher), there exists support for Compute Preemption. This allows compute\\ntasks to be preempted at instruction-level granularity, rather than thread block granularity as in prior\\n\\n6.4. Compute Modes 133\\n\\nhttps://docs.nvidia.com/deploy/cuda-compatibility/index.html\\n\\n\\nCUDA C++ Programming Guide, Release 12.4\\n\\nMaxwell and Kepler GPU architecture, with the benefit that applications with long-running kernels can\\nbe prevented fromeithermonopolizing the systemor timing out. However, therewill be context switch\\noverheads associated with Compute Preemption, which is automatically enabled on those devices for\\nwhich support exists. The individual attribute query function cudaDeviceGetAttribute() with the\\nattribute cudaDevAttrComputePreemptionSupported can be used to determine if the device in use\\nsupports Compute Preemption. Users wishing to avoid context switch overheads associated with dif-\\nferent processes can ensure that only one process is active on the GPU by selecting exclusive-process\\nmode.\\n\\nApplications may query the compute mode of a device by checking the computeMode device property\\n(see Device Enumeration).\\n\\n6.5. Mode Switches\\n\\nGPUs that have a display output dedicate some DRAMmemory to the so-called primary surface, which\\nis used to refresh the display device whose output is viewed by the user. When users initiate a mode\\nswitch of the display by changing the resolution or bit depth of the display (using NVIDIA control\\npanel or the Display control panel on Windows), the amount of memory needed for the primary sur-\\nface changes. For example, if the user changes the display resolution from 1280x1024x32-bit to\\n1600x1200x32-bit, the system must dedicate 7.68 MB to the primary surface rather than 5.24 MB.\\n(Full-screen graphics applications running with anti-aliasing enabled may require much more display\\nmemory for the primary surface.) On Windows, other events that may initiate display mode switches\\ninclude launching a full-screen DirectX application, hitting Alt+Tab to task switch away from a full-\\nscreen DirectX application, or hitting Ctrl+Alt+Del to lock the computer.\\n\\nIf a mode switch increases the amount of memory needed for the primary surface, the system may\\nhave to cannibalize memory allocations dedicated to CUDA applications. Therefore, a mode switch\\nresults in any call to the CUDA runtime to fail and return an invalid context error.\\n\\n6.6. Tesla Compute Cluster Mode for Windows\\n\\nUsing NVIDIA’s System Management Interface (nvidia-smi), the Windows device driver can be put in\\nTCC (Tesla Compute Cluster) mode for devices of the Tesla and Quadro Series.\\n\\nTCC mode removes support for any graphics functionality.\\n\\n134 Chapter 6. Programming Interface\\n\\nindex.html#device-enumeration\\n\\n\\nChapter 7. Hardware Implementation\\n\\nThe NVIDIA GPU architecture is built around a scalable array of multithreaded Streaming Multipro-\\ncessors (SMs). When a CUDA program on the host CPU invokes a kernel grid, the blocks of the grid\\nare enumerated and distributed tomultiprocessors with available execution capacity. The threads of a\\nthread block execute concurrently on onemultiprocessor, andmultiple thread blocks can execute con-\\ncurrently on one multiprocessor. As thread blocks terminate, new blocks are launched on the vacated\\nmultiprocessors.\\n\\nA multiprocessor is designed to execute hundreds of threads concurrently. To manage such a large\\nnumber of threads, it employs a unique architecture called SIMT (Single-Instruction, Multiple-Thread)\\nthat is described in SIMT Architecture. The instructions are pipelined, leveraging instruction-level par-\\nallelismwithin a single thread, as well as extensive thread-level parallelism through simultaneous hard-\\nwaremultithreading as detailed in HardwareMultithreading. Unlike CPU cores, they are issued in order\\nand there is no branch prediction or speculative execution.\\n\\nSIMT Architecture and Hardware Multithreading describe the architecture features of the streaming\\nmultiprocessor that are common to all devices. Compute Capability 5.x, Compute Capability 6.x, and\\nCompute Capability 7.x provide the specifics for devices of compute capabilities 5.x, 6.x, and 7.x re-\\nspectively.\\n\\nThe NVIDIA GPU architecture uses a little-endian representation.\\n\\n7.1. SIMT Architecture\\n\\nThemultiprocessor creates, manages, schedules, and executes threads in groups of 32 parallel threads\\ncalled warps. Individual threads composing a warp start together at the same program address, but\\nthey have their own instruction address counter and register state and are therefore free to branch and\\nexecute independently. The term warp originates from weaving, the first parallel thread technology. A\\nhalf-warp is either the first or second half of a warp. A quarter-warp is either the first, second, third,\\nor fourth quarter of a warp.\\n\\nWhen a multiprocessor is given one or more thread blocks to execute, it partitions them into warps\\nand each warp gets scheduled by a warp scheduler for execution. The way a block is partitioned into\\nwarps is always the same; each warp contains threads of consecutive, increasing thread IDs with the\\nfirst warp containing thread 0. Thread Hierarchy describes how thread IDs relate to thread indices in\\nthe block.\\n\\nA warp executes one common instruction at a time, so full efficiency is realized when all 32 threads of\\na warp agree on their execution path. If threads of a warp diverge via a data-dependent conditional\\nbranch, the warp executes each branch path taken, disabling threads that are not on that path. Branch\\ndivergence occurs only within a warp; different warps execute independently regardless of whether\\nthey are executing common or disjoint code paths.\\n\\n135\\n\\nindex.html#simt-architecture\\nindex.html#hardware-multithreading\\nindex.html#simt-architecture\\nindex.html#hardware-multithreading\\nindex.html#compute-capability-5-x\\nindex.html#compute-capability-6-x\\nindex.html#compute-capability-7-x\\nindex.html#thread-hierarchy\\n\\n\\nCUDA C++ Programming Guide, Release 12.4\\n\\nThe SIMT architecture is akin to SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) vector organizations in that a\\nsingle instruction controls multiple processing elements. A key difference is that SIMD vector organi-\\nzations expose the SIMD width to the software, whereas SIMT instructions specify the execution and\\nbranching behavior of a single thread. In contrast with SIMD vector machines, SIMT enables program-\\nmers to write thread-level parallel code for independent, scalar threads, as well as data-parallel code\\nfor coordinated threads. For the purposes of correctness, the programmer can essentially ignore the\\nSIMT behavior; however, substantial performance improvements can be realized by taking care that\\nthe code seldom requires threads in a warp to diverge. In practice, this is analogous to the role of cache\\nlines in traditional code: Cache line size can be safely ignoredwhen designing for correctness butmust\\nbe considered in the code structure when designing for peak performance. Vector architectures, on\\nthe other hand, require the software to coalesce loads into vectors and manage divergence manually.\\n\\nPrior to NVIDIA Volta, warps used a single program counter shared amongst all 32 threads in the warp\\ntogether with an active mask specifying the active threads of the warp. As a result, threads from the\\nsame warp in divergent regions or different states of execution cannot signal each other or exchange\\ndata, and algorithms requiring fine-grained sharing of data guarded by locks or mutexes can easily\\nlead to deadlock, depending on which warp the contending threads come from.\\n\\nStarting with the NVIDIA Volta architecture, Independent Thread Scheduling allows full concurrency\\nbetween threads, regardless of warp. With Independent Thread Scheduling, the GPU maintains ex-\\necution state per thread, including a program counter and call stack, and can yield execution at a\\nper-thread granularity, either to make better use of execution resources or to allow one thread to wait\\nfor data to be produced by another. A schedule optimizer determines how to group active threads\\nfrom the same warp together into SIMT units. This retains the high throughput of SIMT execution\\nas in prior NVIDIA GPUs, but with much more flexibility: threads can now diverge and reconverge at\\nsub-warp granularity.\\n\\nIndependent Thread Scheduling can lead to a rather different set of threads participating in the ex-\\necuted code than intended if the developer made assumptions about warp-synchronicity7 of previ-\\nous hardware architectures. In particular, any warp-synchronous code (such as synchronization-free,\\nintra-warp reductions) should be revisited to ensure compatibility with NVIDIA Volta and beyond. See\\nCompute Capability 7.x for further details.\\n\\nNote: The threads of a warp that are participating in the current instruction are called the active\\nthreads, whereas threads not on the current instruction are inactive (disabled). Threads can be inactive\\nfor a variety of reasons including having exited earlier than other threads of their warp, having taken a\\ndifferent branch path than the branch path currently executed by the warp, or being the last threads\\nof a block whose number of threads is not a multiple of the warp size.\\n\\nIf a non-atomic instruction executed by a warp writes to the same location in global or sharedmemory\\nfor more than one of the threads of the warp, the number of serialized writes that occur to that loca-\\ntion varies depending on the compute capability of the device (see Compute Capability 5.x, Compute\\nCapability 6.x, and Compute Capability 7.x), and which thread performs the final write is undefined.\\n\\nIf an atomic instruction executed by a warp reads, modifies, and writes to the same location in global\\nmemory for more than one of the threads of the warp, each read/modify/write to that location occurs\\nand they are all serialized, but the order in which they occur is undefined.\\n\\n7 The term warp-synchronous refers to code that implicitly assumes threads in the same warp are synchronized at every\\ninstruction.\\n\\n136 Chapter 7.

Hardware Multithreading\\n\\nThe execution context (program counters, registers, and so on) for each warp processed by a mul-\\ntiprocessor is maintained on-chip during the entire lifetime of the warp. Therefore, switching from\\none execution context to another has no cost, and at every instruction issue time, a warp scheduler\\nselects a warp that has threads ready to execute its next instruction (the active threads of the warp)\\nand issues the instruction to those threads.\\n\\nIn particular, each multiprocessor has a set of 32-bit registers that are partitioned among the warps,\\nand a parallel data cache or shared memory that is partitioned among the thread blocks.\\n\\nThe number of blocks and warps that can reside and be processed together on the multiprocessor\\nfor a given kernel depends on the amount of registers and shared memory used by the kernel and the\\namount of registers and shared memory available on the multiprocessor. There are also a maximum\\nnumber of resident blocks and a maximum number of resident warps per multiprocessor. These limits\\nas well the amount of registers and shared memory available on the multiprocessor are a function of\\nthe compute capability of the device and are given in Compute Capabilities. If there are not enough\\nregisters or shared memory available per multiprocessor to process at least one block, the kernel will\\nfail to launch.\\n\\nThe total number of warps in a block is as follows:\\n\\nceil\\n(\\n\\nT\\nWsize\\n\\n, 1\\n)\\n\\n▶ T is the number of threads per block,\\n\\n▶ Wsize is the warp size, which is equal to 32,\\n\\n▶ ceil(x, y) is equal to x rounded up to the nearest multiple of y.\\n\\nThe total number of registers and total amount of shared memory allocated for a block are docu-\\nmented in the CUDA Occupancy Calculator provided in the CUDA Toolkit.\\n\\n7.2.

Hardware Implementation\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 8. Performance Guidelines\\n\\n8.1. Overall Performance Optimization\\nStrategies\\n\\nPerformance optimization revolves around four basic strategies:\\n\\n▶ Maximize parallel execution to achieve maximum utilization;\\n\\n▶ Optimize memory usage to achieve maximum memory throughput;\\n\\n▶ Optimize instruction usage to achieve maximum instruction throughput;\\n\\n▶ Minimize memory thrashing.\\n\\nWhich strategieswill yield the best performance gain for a particular portion of an application depends\\non the performance limiters for that portion; optimizing instruction usage of a kernel that is mostly\\nlimited by memory accesses will not yield any significant performance gain, for example. Optimization\\nefforts should therefore be constantly directed by measuring and monitoring the performance lim-\\niters, for example using the CUDA profiler. Also, comparing the floating-point operation throughput\\nor memory throughput—whichever makes more sense—of a particular kernel to the corresponding\\npeak theoretical throughput of the device indicates how much room for improvement there is for the\\nkernel.\\n\\n8.2. Maximize Utilization\\n\\nTo maximize utilization the application should be structured in a way that it exposes as much paral-\\nlelism as possible and efficiently maps this parallelism to the various components of the system to\\nkeep them busy most of the time.\\n\\n139\\n\\n\\n\\nCUDA C++ Programming Guide, Release 12.4\\n\\n8.2.1. Application Level\\n\\nAt a high level, the application should maximize parallel execution between the host, the devices, and\\nthe bus connecting the host to the devices, by using asynchronous functions calls and streams as\\ndescribed in Asynchronous Concurrent Execution. It should assign to each processor the type of work\\nit does best: serial workloads to the host; parallel workloads to the devices.\\n\\nFor the parallel workloads, at points in the algorithmwhere parallelism is broken because some threads\\nneed to synchronize in order to share data with each other, there are two cases: Either these threads\\nbelong to the same block, in which case they should use __syncthreads() and share data through\\nshared memory within the same kernel invocation, or they belong to different blocks, in which case\\nthey must share data through global memory using two separate kernel invocations, one for writing\\nto and one for reading from global memory. The second case is much less optimal since it adds the\\noverhead of extra kernel invocations and global memory traffic. Its occurrence should therefore be\\nminimized by mapping the algorithm to the CUDA programming model in such a way that the compu-\\ntations that require inter-thread communication are performed within a single thread block as much\\nas possible.\\n\\n8.2.2. Device Level\\n\\nAt a lower level, the application should maximize parallel execution between the multiprocessors of a\\ndevice.\\n\\nMultiple kernels can execute concurrently on a device, so maximum utilization can also be achieved\\nby using streams to enable enough kernels to execute concurrently as described in Asynchronous\\nConcurrent Execution.\\n\\n8.2.3. Multiprocessor Level\\n\\nAt an even lower level, the application should maximize parallel execution between the various func-\\ntional units within a multiprocessor.\\n\\nAs described in Hardware Multithreading, a GPU multiprocessor primarily relies on thread-level par-\\nallelism to maximize utilization of its functional units. Utilization is therefore directly linked to the\\nnumber of resident warps. At every instruction issue time, a warp scheduler selects an instruction\\nthat is ready to execute. This instruction can be another independent instruction of the same warp,\\nexploiting instruction-level parallelism, or more commonly an instruction of another warp, exploiting\\nthread-level parallelism. If a ready to execute instruction is selected it is issued to the active threads\\nof the warp. The number of clock cycles it takes for a warp to be ready to execute its next instruction\\nis called the latency, and full utilization is achieved when all warp schedulers always have some instruc-\\ntion to issue for some warp at every clock cycle during that latency period, or in other words, when\\nlatency is completely “hidden”. The number of instructions required to hide a latency of L clock cy-\\ncles depends on the respective throughputs of these instructions (see Arithmetic Instructions for the\\nthroughputs of various arithmetic instructions). If we assume instructions withmaximum throughput,\\nit is equal to:\\n\\n▶ 4L for devices of compute capability 5.x, 6.1, 6.2, 7.x and 8.x since for these devices, a multipro-\\ncessor issues one instruction per warp over one clock cycle for four warps at a time, asmentioned\\nin Compute Capabilities.\\n\\n▶ 2L for devices of compute capability 6.0 since for these devices, the two instructions issued every\\ncycle are one instruction for two different warps.\\n\\n140 Chapter 8.

In this\\ncase, the latency is equal to the execution time of the previous instruction and the warp schedulers\\nmust schedule instructions of other warps during that time. Execution time varies depending on the\\ninstruction. On devices of compute capability 7.x, for most arithmetic instructions, it is typically 4\\nclock cycles. This means that 16 active warps per multiprocessor (4 cycles, 4 warp schedulers) are\\nrequired to hide arithmetic instruction latencies (assuming that warps execute instructions with max-\\nimum throughput, otherwise fewer warps are needed). If the individual warps exhibit instruction-level\\nparallelism, i.e. have multiple independent instructions in their instruction stream, fewer warps are\\nneeded because multiple independent instructions from a single warp can be issued back to back.\\n\\nIf some input operand resides in off-chip memory, the latency is much higher: typically hundreds of\\nclock cycles. The number of warps required to keep the warp schedulers busy during such high la-\\ntency periods depends on the kernel code and its degree of instruction-level parallelism. In general,\\nmore warps are required if the ratio of the number of instructions with no off-chip memory operands\\n(i.e., arithmetic instructions most of the time) to the number of instructions with off-chip memory\\noperands is low (this ratio is commonly called the arithmetic intensity of the program).\\n\\nAnother reason a warp is not ready to execute its next instruction is that it is waiting at somememory\\nfence (Memory Fence Functions) or synchronization point (Synchronization Functions). A synchro-\\nnization point can force the multiprocessor to idle as more and more warps wait for other warps in the\\nsame block to complete execution of instructions prior to the synchronization point. Having multiple\\nresident blocks per multiprocessor can help reduce idling in this case, as warps from different blocks\\ndo not need to wait for each other at synchronization points.\\n\\nThe number of blocks and warps residing on each multiprocessor for a given kernel call depends\\non the execution configuration of the call (Execution Configuration), the memory resources of the\\nmultiprocessor, and the resource requirements of the kernel as described in Hardware Multithread-\\ning. Register and shared memory usage are reported by the compiler when compiling with the\\n--ptxas-options=-v option.\\n\\nThe total amount of sharedmemory required for a block is equal to the sum of the amount of statically\\nallocated shared memory and the amount of dynamically allocated shared memory.\\n\\nThe number of registers used by a kernel can have a significant impact on the number of resident\\nwarps. For example, for devices of compute capability 6.x, if a kernel uses 64 registers and each block\\nhas 512 threads and requires very little shared memory, then two blocks (i.e., 32 warps) can reside\\non the multiprocessor since they require 2x512x64 registers, which exactly matches the number of\\nregisters available on the multiprocessor. But as soon as the kernel uses one more register, only one\\nblock (i.e., 16 warps) can be resident since two blocks would require 2x512x65 registers, which are\\nmore registers than are available on the multiprocessor. Therefore, the compiler attempts to min-\\nimize register usage while keeping register spilling (see Device Memory Accesses) and the number\\nof instructions to a minimum. Register usage can be controlled using the maxrregcount compiler\\noption, the __launch_bounds__() qualifier as described in Launch Bounds, or the __maxnreg__()\\nqualifier as described in Maximum Number of Registers per Thread.\\n\\nThe register file is organized as 32-bit registers. So, each variable stored in a register needs at least\\none 32-bit register, for example, a double variable uses two 32-bit registers.\\n\\nThe effect of execution configuration on performance for a given kernel call generally depends on the\\nkernel code. Experimentation is therefore recommended. Applications can also parametrize execution\\nconfigurations based on register file size and shared memory size, which depends on the compute\\ncapability of the device, as well as on the number of multiprocessors and memory bandwidth of the\\ndevice, all of which can be queried using the runtime (see reference manual).\\n\\n8.2.

Maximize Memory Throughput\\n\\nThe first step in maximizing overall memory throughput for the application is to minimize data trans-\\nfers with low bandwidth.\\n\\nThat means minimizing data transfers between the host and the device, as detailed in Data Transfer\\nbetween Host and Device, since these havemuch lower bandwidth than data transfers between global\\nmemory and the device.\\n\\nThat also means minimizing data transfers between global memory and the device by maximizing use\\nof on-chip memory: shared memory and caches (i.e., L1 cache and L2 cache available on devices of\\ncompute capability 2.x and higher, texture cache and constant cache available on all devices).\\n\\nShared memory is equivalent to a user-managed cache: The application explicitly allocates and ac-\\ncesses it. As illustrated in CUDA Runtime, a typical programming pattern is to stage data coming from\\ndevice memory into shared memory; in other words, to have each thread of a block:\\n\\n▶ Load data from device memory to shared memory,\\n\\n▶ Synchronize with all the other threads of the block so that each thread can safely read shared\\nmemory locations that were populated by different threads,\\n\\n▶ Process the data in shared memory,\\n\\n144 Chapter 8. Performance Guidelines\\n\\nindex.html#data-transfer-between-host-and-device\\nindex.html#data-transfer-between-host-and-device\\nindex.html#cuda-c-runtime\\n\\n\\nCUDA C++ Programming Guide, Release 12.4\\n\\n▶ Synchronize again if necessary to make sure that shared memory has been updated with the\\nresults,\\n\\n▶ Write the results back to device memory.\\n\\nFor some applications (for example, for which global memory access patterns are data-dependent),\\na traditional hardware-managed cache is more appropriate to exploit data locality. As mentioned in\\nCompute Capability 7.x, Compute Capability 8.x and Compute Capability 9.0, for devices of compute\\ncapability 7.x, 8.x and 9.0, the same on-chip memory is used for both L1 and shared memory, and how\\nmuch of it is dedicated to L1 versus shared memory is configurable for each kernel call.\\n\\nThe throughput of memory accesses by a kernel can vary by an order of magnitude depending on ac-\\ncess pattern for each type of memory. The next step in maximizing memory throughput is therefore\\nto organize memory accesses as optimally as possible based on the optimal memory access patterns\\ndescribed in Device Memory Accesses. This optimization is especially important for global memory\\naccesses as global memory bandwidth is low compared to available on-chip bandwidths and arith-\\nmetic instruction throughput, so non-optimal global memory accesses generally have a high impact\\non performance.\\n\\n8.3.1. Data Transfer between Host and Device\\n\\nApplications should strive to minimize data transfer between the host and the device. One way to\\naccomplish this is to move more code from the host to the device, even if that means running kernels\\nthat do not expose enough parallelism to execute on the device with full efficiency. Intermediate data\\nstructures may be created in device memory, operated on by the device, and destroyed without ever\\nbeing mapped by the host or copied to host memory.\\n\\nAlso, because of the overhead associated with each transfer, batching many small transfers into a\\nsingle large transfer always performs better than making each transfer separately.\\n\\nOn systems with a front-side bus, higher performance for data transfers between host and device is\\nachieved by using page-locked host memory as described in Page-Locked Host Memory.\\n\\nIn addition, when using mapped page-locked memory (Mapped Memory), there is no need to allocate\\nany device memory and explicitly copy data between device and host memory. Data transfers are\\nimplicitly performed each time the kernel accesses the mapped memory. For maximum performance,\\nthese memory accesses must be coalesced as with accesses to global memory (see Device Memory\\nAccesses). Assuming that they are and that the mapped memory is read or written only once, using\\nmapped page-locked memory instead of explicit copies between device and host memory can be a\\nwin for performance.\\n\\nOn integrated systems where device memory and host memory are physically the same, any copy\\nbetween host and device memory is superfluous and mapped page-locked memory should be used\\ninstead. Applications may query a device is integrated by checking that the integrated device prop-\\nerty (see Device Enumeration) is equal to 1.\\n\\n8.3.

Device Memory Accesses\\n\\nAn instruction that accesses addressable memory (i.e., global, local, shared, constant, or texturemem-\\nory)might need to be re-issuedmultiple times depending on the distribution of thememory addresses\\nacross the threads within the warp. How the distribution affects the instruction throughput this way\\nis specific to each type of memory and described in the following sections. For example, for global\\nmemory, as a general rule, the more scattered the addresses are, the more reduced the throughput is.\\n\\nGlobal Memory\\n\\nGlobal memory resides in device memory and device memory is accessed via 32-, 64-, or 128-byte\\nmemory transactions. Thesememory transactionsmust be naturally aligned: Only the 32-, 64-, or 128-\\nbyte segments of device memory that are aligned to their size (i.e., whose first address is a multiple\\nof their size) can be read or written by memory transactions.\\n\\nWhen a warp executes an instruction that accesses global memory, it coalesces thememory accesses\\nof the threads within the warp into one or more of these memory transactions depending on the size\\nof theword accessed by each thread and the distribution of thememory addresses across the threads.\\nIn general, the more transactions are necessary, the more unused words are transferred in addition to\\nthe words accessed by the threads, reducing the instruction throughput accordingly. For example, if a\\n32-byte memory transaction is generated for each thread’s 4-byte access, throughput is divided by 8.\\n\\nHowmany transactions are necessary and howmuch throughput is ultimately affected varies with the\\ncompute capability of the device. Compute Capability 5.x, Compute Capability 6.x, Compute Capabil-\\nity 7.x, Compute Capability 8.x and Compute Capability 9.0 give more details on how global memory\\naccesses are handled for various compute capabilities.\\n\\nTo maximize global memory throughput, it is therefore important to maximize coalescing by:\\n\\n▶ Following the most optimal access patterns based on Compute Capability 5.x, Compute Capabil-\\nity 6.x, Compute Capability 7.x, Compute Capability 8.x and Compute Capability 9.0\\n\\n▶ Using data types that meet the size and alignment requirement detailed in the section Size and\\nAlignment Requirement below,\\n\\n▶ Padding data in some cases, for example, when accessing a two-dimensional array as described\\nin the section Two-Dimensional Arrays below.\\n\\nSize and Alignment Requirement\\n\\nGlobal memory instructions support reading or writing words of size equal to 1, 2, 4, 8, or 16 bytes.\\nAny access (via a variable or a pointer) to data residing in global memory compiles to a single global\\nmemory instruction if and only if the size of the data type is 1, 2, 4, 8, or 16 bytes and the data is\\nnaturally aligned (i.e., its address is a multiple of that size).\\n\\nIf this size and alignment requirement is not fulfilled, the access compiles to multiple instructions\\nwith interleaved access patterns that prevent these instructions from fully coalescing. It is therefore\\nrecommended to use types that meet this requirement for data that resides in global memory.\\n\\nThe alignment requirement is automatically fulfilled for the Built-in Vector Types.\\n\\nFor structures, the size and alignment requirements can be enforced by the compiler using the align-\\nment specifiers__align__(8) or __align__(16), such as\\n\\nstruct __align__(8) {\\nfloat x;\\nfloat y;\\n\\n};\\n\\nor\\n\\n146 Chapter 8.

A typical case where this might be easily overlooked is when using some cus-\\ntom global memory allocation scheme, whereby the allocations of multiple arrays (with multiple calls\\nto cudaMalloc() or cuMemAlloc()) is replaced by the allocation of a single large block of memory\\npartitioned into multiple arrays, in which case the starting address of each array is offset from the\\nblock’s starting address.\\n\\nTwo-Dimensional Arrays\\n\\nA common global memory access pattern is when each thread of index (tx,ty) uses the following\\naddress to access one element of a 2D array of width width, located at address BaseAddress of type\\ntype* (where typemeets the requirement described in Maximize Utilization):\\n\\nBaseAddress + width * ty + tx\\n\\nFor these accesses to be fully coalesced, both the width of the thread block and the width of the array\\nmust be a multiple of the warp size.\\n\\nIn particular, this means that an array whose width is not a multiple of this size will be accessed much\\nmore efficiently if it is actually allocated with a width rounded up to the closest multiple of this size\\nand its rows padded accordingly. The cudaMallocPitch() and cuMemAllocPitch() functions and\\nassociated memory copy functions described in the reference manual enable programmers to write\\nnon-hardware-dependent code to allocate arrays that conform to these constraints.\\n\\nLocal Memory\\n\\nLocal memory accesses only occur for some automatic variables as mentioned in Variable Memory\\nSpace Specifiers. Automatic variables that the compiler is likely to place in local memory are:\\n\\n▶ Arrays for which it cannot determine that they are indexed with constant quantities,\\n\\n▶ Large structures or arrays that would consume too much register space,\\n\\n▶ Any variable if the kernel usesmore registers than available (this is also known as register spilling).\\n\\nInspection of the PTX assembly code (obtained by compiling with the -ptx or-keep option) will tell if a\\nvariable has been placed in localmemory during the first compilation phases as it will be declared using\\nthe.localmnemonic and accessed using theld.local andst.localmnemonics. Even if it has not,\\nsubsequent compilation phasesmight still decide otherwise though if they find it consumes toomuch\\nregister space for the targeted architecture: Inspection of the cubin object using cuobjdumpwill tell if\\nthis is the case. Also, the compiler reports total local memory usage per kernel (lmem) when compiling\\nwith the --ptxas-options=-v option. Note that somemathematical functions have implementation\\npaths that might access local memory.\\n\\nThe local memory space resides in device memory, so local memory accesses have the same high\\nlatency and low bandwidth as global memory accesses and are subject to the same requirements for\\nmemory coalescing as described in Device Memory Accesses. Local memory is however organized\\nsuch that consecutive 32-bit words are accessed by consecutive thread IDs. Accesses are therefore\\nfully coalesced as long as all threads in a warp access the same relative address (for example, same\\nindex in an array variable, same member in a structure variable).\\n\\n8.3.

Any memory read or write request made of n addresses that\\nfall in n distinct memory banks can therefore be serviced simultaneously, yielding an overall bandwidth\\nthat is n times as high as the bandwidth of a single module.\\n\\nHowever, if two addresses of a memory request fall in the same memory bank, there is a bank conflict\\nand the access has to be serialized. The hardware splits a memory request with bank conflicts into\\nas many separate conflict-free requests as necessary, decreasing throughput by a factor equal to the\\nnumber of separate memory requests. If the number of separate memory requests is n, the initial\\nmemory request is said to cause n-way bank conflicts.\\n\\nTo get maximum performance, it is therefore important to understand how memory addresses map\\nto memory banks in order to schedule the memory requests so as to minimize bank conflicts. This\\nis described in Compute Capability 5.x, Compute Capability 6.x, Compute Capability 7.x, Compute Ca-\\npability 8.x, and Compute Capability 9.0 for devices of compute capability 5.x, 6.x, 7.x, 8.x, and 9.0\\nrespectively.\\n\\nConstant Memory\\n\\nThe constant memory space resides in device memory and is cached in the constant cache.\\n\\nA request is then split into as many separate requests as there are different memory addresses in the\\ninitial request, decreasing throughput by a factor equal to the number of separate requests.\\n\\nThe resulting requests are then serviced at the throughput of the constant cache in case of a cache\\nhit, or at the throughput of device memory otherwise.\\n\\nTexture and Surface Memory\\n\\nThe texture and surface memory spaces reside in device memory and are cached in texture cache, so\\na texture fetch or surface read costs one memory read from device memory only on a cache miss,\\notherwise it just costs one read from texture cache. The texture cache is optimized for 2D spatial\\nlocality, so threads of the same warp that read texture or surface addresses that are close together in\\n2D will achieve best performance. Also, it is designed for streaming fetches with a constant latency;\\na cache hit reduces DRAM bandwidth demand but not fetch latency.\\n\\nReading device memory through texture or surface fetching present some benefits that can make it\\nan advantageous alternative to reading device memory from global or constant memory:\\n\\n▶ If the memory reads do not follow the access patterns that global or constant memory reads\\nmust follow to get good performance, higher bandwidth can be achieved providing that there is\\nlocality in the texture fetches or surface reads;\\n\\n▶ Addressing calculations are performed outside the kernel by dedicated units;\\n\\n▶ Packed data may be broadcast to separate variables in a single operation;\\n\\n▶ 8-bit and 16-bit integer input data may be optionally converted to 32 bit floating-point values in\\nthe range [0.0, 1.0] or [-1.0, 1.0] (see Texture Memory).\\n\\n148 Chapter 8.

The slow path is used for arguments large in magnitude and consists of\\nlengthy computations required to achieve correct results over the entire argument range.\\n\\nAt present, the argument reduction code for the trigonometric functions selects the fast path for\\narguments whose magnitude is less than 105615.0f for the single-precision functions, and less than\\n2147483648.0 for the double-precision functions.\\n\\nAs the slow path requires more registers than the fast path, an attempt has been made to reduce\\nregister pressure in the slow path by storing some intermediate variables in local memory, which may\\naffect performance because of local memory high latency and bandwidth (see Device Memory Ac-\\ncesses). At present, 28 bytes of local memory are used by single-precision functions, and 44 bytes are\\nused by double-precision functions. However, the exact amount is subject to change.\\n\\nDue to the lengthy computations and use of local memory in the slow path, the throughput of these\\ntrigonometric functions is lower by one order of magnitude when the slow path reduction is required\\nas opposed to the fast path reduction.\\n\\nInteger Arithmetic\\n\\nInteger division and modulo operation are costly as they compile to up to 20 instructions. They\\ncan be replaced with bitwise operations in some cases: If n is a power of 2, (i∕n) is equivalent to\\n(i>>log2(n)) and (i%n) is equivalent to (i&(n-1)); the compiler will perform these conversions if\\nn is literal.\\n\\n__brev and __popcmap to a single instruction and __brevll and __popcll to a few instructions.\\n\\n__[u]mul24 are legacy intrinsic functions that no longer have any reason to be used.\\n\\nHalf Precision Arithmetic\\n\\nIn order to achieve good performance for 16-bit precision floating-point add, multiply or multiply-add,\\nit is recommended that the half2 datatype is used for half precision and __nv_bfloat162 be used\\nfor __nv_bfloat16 precision. Vector intrinsics (for example, __hadd2, __hsub2, __hmul2, __hfma2)\\ncan then be used to do two operations in a single instruction. Using half2 or __nv_bfloat162 in\\nplace of two calls using half or __nv_bfloat16may also help performance of other intrinsics, such\\nas warp shuffles.\\n\\nThe intrinsic__halves2half2 is provided to convert twohalfprecision values to thehalf2datatype.\\n\\nThe intrinsic __halves2bfloat162 is provided to convert two __nv_bfloat precision values to the\\n__nv_bfloat162 datatype.\\n\\nType Conversion\\n\\nSometimes, the compiler must insert conversion instructions, introducing additional execution cycles.\\nThis is the case for:\\n\\n▶ Functions operating on variables of type char or short whose operands generally need to be\\nconverted to int,\\n\\n▶ Double-precision floating-point constants (i.e., those constants defined without any type suffix)\\nused as input to single-precision floating-point computations (asmandated by C/C++ standards).\\n\\nThis last case can be avoided by using single-precision floating-point constants, defined with an f\\nsuffix such as 3.141592653589793f, 1.0f, 0.5f.\\n\\n8.4. Maximize Instruction Throughput 155\\n\\nindex.html#mathematical-functions\\nindex.html#device-memory-accesses\\nindex.html#device-memory-accesses\\n\\n\\nCUDA C++ Programming Guide, Release 12.4\\n\\n8.4.2. Control Flow Instructions\\n\\nAny flow control instruction (if, switch, do, for, while) can significantly impact the effective in-\\nstruction throughput by causing threads of the same warp to diverge (i.e., to follow different execu-\\ntion paths). If this happens, the different executions paths have to be serialized, increasing the total\\nnumber of instructions executed for this warp.\\n\\nTo obtain best performance in cases where the control flow depends on the thread ID, the controlling\\ncondition should be written so as to minimize the number of divergent warps. This is possible because\\nthe distribution of the warps across the block is deterministic as mentioned in SIMT Architecture. A\\ntrivial example is when the controlling condition only depends on (threadIdx ∕ warpSize) where\\nwarpSize is the warp size. In this case, no warp diverges since the controlling condition is perfectly\\naligned with the warps.\\n\\nSometimes, the compiler may unroll loops or it may optimize out short if or switch blocks by using\\nbranch predication instead, as detailed below. In these cases, no warp can ever diverge. The program-\\nmer can also control loop unrolling using the #pragma unroll directive (see #pragma unroll).\\n\\nWhen using branch predication none of the instructions whose execution depends on the control-\\nling condition gets skipped. Instead, each of them is associated with a per-thread condition code or\\npredicate that is set to true or false based on the controlling condition and although each of these\\ninstructions gets scheduled for execution, only the instructions with a true predicate are actually ex-\\necuted. Instructions with a false predicate do not write results, and also do not evaluate addresses or\\nread operands.\\n\\n8.4.3. Synchronization Instruction\\n\\nThroughput for __syncthreads() is 32 operations per clock cycle for devices of compute capability\\n6.0, 16 operations per clock cycle for devices of compute capability 7.x as well as 8.x and 64 operations\\nper clock cycle for devices of compute capability 5.x, 6.1 and 6.2.\\n\\nNote that__syncthreads() can impact performance by forcing themultiprocessor to idle as detailed\\nin Device Memory Accesses.\\n\\n8.5. Minimize Memory Thrashing\\n\\nApplications that constantly allocate and freememory too oftenmay find that the allocation calls tend\\nto get slower over time up to a limit. This is typically expected due to the nature of releasing memory\\nback to the operating system for its own use. For best performance in this regard, we recommend the\\nfollowing:\\n\\n▶ Try to size your allocation to the problem at hand. Don’t try to allocate all available memory with\\ncudaMalloc / cudaMallocHost / cuMemCreate, as this forces memory to be resident immedi-\\nately and prevents other applications from being able to use that memory. This can put more\\npressure on operating system schedulers, or just prevent other applications using the same GPU\\nfrom running entirely.\\n\\n▶ Try to allocate memory in appropriately sized allocations early in the application and alloca-\\ntions only when the application does not have any use for it. Reduce the number of cudaMal-\\nloc+cudaFree calls in the application, especially in performance-critical regions.\\n\\n156 Chapter 8.

Function Execution Space Specifiers\\n\\nFunction execution space specifiers denote whether a function executes on the host or on the device\\nand whether it is callable from the host or from the device.\\n\\n10.1.1. __global__\\n\\nThe __global__ execution space specifier declares a function as being a kernel. Such a function is:\\n\\n▶ Executed on the device,\\n\\n▶ Callable from the host,\\n\\n▶ Callable from the device for devices of compute capability 5.0 or higher (see CUDA Dynamic\\nParallelism for more details).\\n\\nA __global__ function must have void return type, and cannot be a member of a class.\\n\\nAny call to a __global__ function must specify its execution configuration as described in Execution\\nConfiguration.\\n\\nA call to a __global__ function is asynchronous, meaning it returns before the device has completed\\nits execution.\\n\\n10.1.2. __device__\\n\\nThe __device__ execution space specifier declares a function that is:\\n\\n▶ Executed on the device,\\n\\n▶ Callable from the device only.\\n\\nThe __global__ and __device__ execution space specifiers cannot be used together.\\n\\n161\\n\\nindex.html#cuda-dynamic-parallelism\\nindex.html#cuda-dynamic-parallelism\\nindex.html#execution-configuration\\nindex.html#execution-configuration\\n\\n\\nCUDA C++ Programming Guide, Release 12.4\\n\\n10.1.3. __host__\\n\\nThe __host__ execution space specifier declares a function that is:\\n\\n▶ Executed on the host,\\n\\n▶ Callable from the host only.\\n\\nIt is equivalent to declare a function with only the __host__ execution space specifier or to declare it\\nwithout any of the __host__, __device__, or __global__ execution space specifier; in either case\\nthe function is compiled for the host only.\\n\\nThe __global__ and __host__ execution space specifiers cannot be used together.\\n\\nThe __device__ and __host__ execution space specifiers can be used together however, in which\\ncase the function is compiled for both the host and the device.

Unlike __forcein-\\nline__, it does not imply that the function is inline. It can be used to improve inlining across modules\\nwhen using LTO.\\n\\nNeither the __noinline__ nor the __forceinline__ function qualifier can be used with the __in-\\nline_hint__ function qualifier.\\n\\n10.2. Variable Memory Space Specifiers\\n\\nVariable memory space specifiers denote the memory location on the device of a variable.\\n\\nAn automatic variable declared in device code without any of the __device__, __shared__ and\\n__constant__memory space specifiers described in this section generally resides in a register. How-\\never in some cases the compiler might choose to place it in local memory, which can have adverse\\nperformance consequences as detailed in Device Memory Accesses.\\n\\n10.2.1. __device__\\n\\nThe __device__memory space specifier declares a variable that resides on the device.\\n\\nAt most one of the other memory space specifiers defined in the next three sections may be used\\ntogether with __device__ to further denote which memory space the variable belongs to. If none of\\nthem is present, the variable:\\n\\n▶ Resides in global memory space,\\n\\n▶ Has the lifetime of the CUDA context in which it is created,\\n\\n▶ Has a distinct object per device,\\n\\n▶ Is accessible from all the threads within the grid and from the host through the runtime library\\n(cudaGetSymbolAddress() / cudaGetSymbolSize() / cudaMemcpyToSymbol() / cudaMem-\\ncpyFromSymbol()).\\n\\n10.2.2. __constant__\\n\\nThe __constant__ memory space specifier, optionally used together with __device__, declares a\\nvariable that:\\n\\n▶ Resides in constant memory space,\\n\\n▶ Has the lifetime of the CUDA context in which it is created,\\n\\n▶ Has a distinct object per device,\\n\\n▶ Is accessible from all the threads within the grid and from the host through the runtime library\\n(cudaGetSymbolAddress() / cudaGetSymbolSize() / cudaMemcpyToSymbol() / cudaMem-\\ncpyFromSymbol()).\\n\\n10.2.

All variables declared\\nin this fashion, start at the same address in memory, so that the layout of the variables in the array\\nmust be explicitly managed through offsets. For example, if one wants the equivalent of\\n\\nshort array0[128];\\nfloat array1[64];\\nint array2[256];\\n\\nin dynamically allocated shared memory, one could declare and initialize the arrays the following way:\\n\\nextern __shared__ float array[];\\n__device__ void func() ∕∕ __device__ or __global__ function\\n{\\n\\nshort* array0 = (short*)array;\\nfloat* array1 = (float*)&array0[128];\\nint* array2 = (int*)&array1[64];\\n\\n}\\n\\nNote that pointers need to be aligned to the type they point to, so the following code, for example,\\ndoes not work since array1 is not aligned to 4 bytes.\\n\\nextern __shared__ float array[];\\n__device__ void func() ∕∕ __device__ or __global__ function\\n{\\n\\nshort* array0 = (short*)array;\\nfloat* array1 = (float*)&array0[127];\\n\\n}\\n\\nAlignment requirements for the built-in vector types are listed in Table 5.\\n\\n164 Chapter 10.

Annotating a\\n__global__ function parameter with __grid_constant__ ensures that the compiler will not create\\na copy of the kernel parameter in thread local memory, but will instead use the generic address of the\\nparameter itself. Avoiding the local copy may result in improved performance.\\n\\n__device__ void unknown_function(S const&);\\n__global__ void kernel(const __grid_constant__ S s) {\\n\\ns.x += threadIdx.x; ∕∕ Undefined Behavior: tried to modify read-only memory\\n\\n∕∕ Compiler will _not_ create a per-thread thread local copy of \"s\":\\nunknown_function(s);\\n\\n}\\n\\n10.2.5. __managed__\\n\\nThe __managed__ memory space specifier, optionally used together with __device__, declares a\\nvariable that:\\n\\n▶ Can be referenced from both device and host code, for example, its address can be taken or it\\ncan be read or written directly from a device or host function.\\n\\n▶ Has the lifetime of an application.\\n\\nSee __managed__ Memory Space Specifier for more details.\\n\\n10.2. Variable Memory Space Specifiers 165\\n\\nindex.html#managed-specifier\\n\\n\\nCUDA C++ Programming Guide, Release 12.4\\n\\n10.2.6. __restrict__\\n\\nnvcc supports restricted pointers via the __restrict__ keyword.\\n\\nRestricted pointers were introduced in C99 to alleviate the aliasing problem that exists in C-type lan-\\nguages, and which inhibits all kind of optimization from code re-ordering to common sub-expression\\nelimination.\\n\\nHere is an example subject to the aliasing issue, where use of restricted pointer can help the compiler\\nto reduce the number of instructions:\\n\\nvoid foo(const float* a,\\nconst float* b,\\nfloat* c)\\n\\n{\\nc[0] = a[0] * b[0];\\nc[1] = a[0] * b[0];\\nc[2] = a[0] * b[0] * a[1];\\nc[3] = a[0] * a[1];\\nc[4] = a[0] * b[0];\\nc[5] = b[0];\\n...\\n\\n}\\n\\nIn C-type languages, the pointers a, b, and c may be aliased, so any write through c could modify\\nelements of a or b. This means that to guarantee functional correctness, the compiler cannot load\\na[0] and b[0] into registers, multiply them, and store the result to both c[0] and c[1], because\\nthe results would differ from the abstract execution model if, say, a[0] is really the same location as\\nc[0]. So the compiler cannot take advantage of the common sub-expression. Likewise, the compiler\\ncannot just reorder the computation of c[4] into the proximity of the computation of c[0] and c[1]\\nbecause the preceding write to c[3] could change the inputs to the computation of c[4].\\n\\nBy making a, b, and c restricted pointers, the programmer asserts to the compiler that the pointers\\nare in fact not aliased, which in this case means writes through c would never overwrite elements of a\\nor b. This changes the function prototype as follows:\\n\\nvoid foo(const float* __restrict__ a,\\nconst float* __restrict__ b,\\nfloat* __restrict__ c);\\n\\nNote that all pointer arguments need to be made restricted for the compiler optimizer to derive any\\nbenefit. With the __restrict__ keywords added, the compiler can now reorder and do common\\nsub-expression elimination at will, while retaining functionality identical with the abstract execution\\nmodel:\\n\\nvoid foo(const float* __restrict__ a,\\nconst float* __restrict__ b,\\nfloat* __restrict__ c)\\n\\n{\\nfloat t0 = a[0];\\nfloat t1 = b[0];\\nfloat t2 = t0 * t1;\\nfloat t3 = a[1];\\nc[0] = t2;\\nc[1] = t2;\\nc[4] = t2;\\nc[2] = t2 * t3;\\n\\n(continues on next page)\\n\\n166 Chapter 10. C++ Language Extensions\\n\\n\\n\\nCUDA C++ Programming Guide, Release 12.4\\n\\n(continued from previous page)\\n\\nc[3] = t0 * t3;\\nc[5] = t1;\\n...\\n\\n}\\n\\nThe effects here are a reduced number of memory accesses and reduced number of computa-\\ntions. This is balanced by an increase in register pressure due to “cached” loads and common sub-\\nexpressions.\\n\\nSince register pressure is a critical issue in many CUDA codes, use of restricted pointers can have\\nnegative performance impact on CUDA code, due to reduced occupancy.\\n\\n10.3.

If thread\\n1 and 2 do not belong to the same block, __threadfence() must be used if they are CUDA threads\\nfrom the same device and __threadfence_system() must be used if they are CUDA threads from\\ntwo different devices.\\n\\nA common use case is when threads consume some data produced by other threads as illustrated by\\nthe following code sample of a kernel that computes the sumof an array of N numbers in one call. Each\\nblock first sums a subset of the array and stores the result in global memory. When all blocks are done,\\nthe last block done reads each of these partial sums from global memory and sums them to obtain\\nthe final result. In order to determine which block is finished last, each block atomically increments\\na counter to signal that it is done with computing and storing its partial sum (see Atomic Functions\\nabout atomic functions). The last block is the one that receives the counter value equal to gridDim.\\nx-1. If no fence is placed between storing the partial sum and incrementing the counter, the counter\\nmight increment before the partial sum is stored and therefore, might reach gridDim.x-1 and let the\\nlast block start reading partial sums before they have been actually updated in memory.\\n\\nMemory fence functions only affect the ordering of memory operations by a thread; they do not, by\\nthemselves, ensure that thesememory operations are visible to other threads (like __syncthreads()\\ndoes for threads within a block (see Synchronization Functions)). In the code sample below, the visi-\\nbility of memory operations on the result variable is ensured by declaring it as volatile (see Volatile\\nQualifier).\\n\\n__device__ unsigned int count = 0;\\n__shared__ bool isLastBlockDone;\\n__global__ void sum(const float* array, unsigned int N,\\n\\nvolatile float* result)\\n(continues on next page)\\n\\n10.5.

Atomic Functions\\n\\nAn atomic function performs a read-modify-write atomic operation on one 32-bit, 64-bit, or 128-bit\\nword residing in global or shared memory. In the case of float2 or float4, the read-modify-write\\noperation is performed on each element of the vector residing in global memory. For example, atom-\\nicAdd() reads a word at some address in global or shared memory, adds a number to it, and writes\\nthe result back to the same address. Atomic functions can only be used in device functions.\\n\\nThe atomic functions described in this section have ordering cuda::memory_order_relaxed and are only\\natomic at a particular scope:\\n\\n▶ Atomic APIs with _system suffix (example: __atomicAdd_system) are atomic at scope\\ncuda::thread_scope_system if they meet particular conditions.\\n\\n▶ Atomic APIs without a suffix (example: __atomicAdd) are atomic at scope\\ncuda::thread_scope_device.\\n\\n▶ Atomic APIs with _block suffix (example: __atomicAdd_block) are atomic at scope\\ncuda::thread_scope_block.\\n\\nIn the following example both the CPU and the GPU atomically update an integer value at address\\naddr:\\n\\n__global__ void mykernel(int *addr) {\\natomicAdd_system(addr, 10); ∕∕ only available on devices with compute�\\n\\n↪→capability 6.x\\n}\\n\\nvoid foo() {\\nint *addr;\\ncudaMallocManaged(&addr, 4);\\n*addr = 0;\\n\\nmykernel<<<...>>>(addr);\\n__sync_fetch_and_add(addr, 10); ∕∕ CPU atomic operation\\n\\n}\\n\\nNote that any atomic operation can be implemented based on atomicCAS() (Compare And Swap). For\\nexample, atomicAdd() for double-precision floating-point numbers is not available on devices with\\ncompute capability lower than 6.0 but it can be implemented as follows:\\n\\n#if __CUDA_ARCH__ < 600\\n__device__ double atomicAdd(double* address, double val)\\n{\\n\\nunsigned long long int* address_as_ull =\\n(unsigned long long int*)address;\\n\\nunsigned long long int old = *address_as_ull, assumed;\\n\\ndo {\\nassumed = old;\\nold = atomicCAS(address_as_ull, assumed,\\n\\n__double_as_longlong(val +\\n(continues on next page)\\n\\n186 Chapter 10.

Description\\n\\nThe __shfl_sync() intrinsics permit exchanging of a variable between threadswithin a warpwithout\\nuse of sharedmemory. The exchange occurs simultaneously for all active threads within the warp (and\\nnamed in mask), moving 4 or 8 bytes of data per thread depending on the type.\\n\\nThreads within a warp are referred to as lanes, and may have an index between 0 and warpSize-1\\n(inclusive).

If srcLane is outside the range [0:width-1], the value returned corresponds to\\nthe value of var held by the srcLane modulo width (i.e. within the same subsection).\\n\\n__shfl_up_sync() calculates a source lane ID by subtracting delta from the caller’s lane ID. The\\nvalue of var held by the resulting lane ID is returned: in effect, var is shifted up the warp by delta\\nlanes. If width is less than warpSize then each subsection of the warp behaves as a separate entity\\nwith a starting logical lane ID of 0. The source lane index will not wrap around the value of width, so\\neffectively the lower delta lanes will be unchanged.\\n\\n__shfl_down_sync() calculates a source lane ID by adding delta to the caller’s lane ID. The value\\nof var held by the resulting lane ID is returned: this has the effect of shifting var down the warp by\\ndelta lanes. If width is less than warpSize then each subsection of the warp behaves as a separate\\nentity with a starting logical lane ID of 0. As for __shfl_up_sync(), the ID number of the source lane\\nwill not wrap around the value of width and so the upper delta lanes will remain unchanged.\\n\\n__shfl_xor_sync() calculates a source line IDbyperforming abitwiseXORof the caller’s lane IDwith\\nlaneMask: the value of var held by the resulting lane ID is returned. If width is less than warpSize\\nthen each group of width consecutive threads are able to access elements from earlier groups of\\nthreads, however if they attempt to access elements from later groups of threads their own value of\\nvar will be returned. This mode implements a butterfly addressing pattern such as is used in tree\\nreduction and broadcast.\\n\\nThe new *_sync shfl intrinsics take in a mask indicating the threads participating in the call. A bit,\\nrepresenting the thread’s lane id, must be set for each participating thread to ensure they are properly\\nconverged before the intrinsic is executed by the hardware.

Alternate Floating Point\\n\\nTensor Cores support alternate types of floating point operations on devices with compute capability\\n8.0 and higher.\\n\\n__nv_bfloat16\\nThis data format is an alternate fp16 format that has the same range as f32 but reduced pre-\\ncision (7 bits). You can use this data format directly with the __nv_bfloat16 type available in\\ncuda_bf16.h. Matrix fragments with __nv_bfloat16 data types are required to be composed\\nwith accumulators of float type. The shapes and operations supported are the same as with\\n__half.\\n\\ntf32\\nThis data format is a special floating point format supported by Tensor Cores, with the same\\nrange as f32 and reduced precision (>=10 bits). The internal layout of this format is implementa-\\ntion defined. In order to use this floating point formatwithWMMAoperations, the inputmatrices\\nmust be manually converted to tf32 precision.\\n\\nTo facilitate conversion, a new intrinsic __float_to_tf32 is provided. While the input and out-\\nput arguments to the intrinsic are of float type, the output will be tf32 numerically. This new\\nprecision is intended to be used with Tensor Cores only, and if mixed with other floattype op-\\nerations, the precision and range of the result will be undefined.\\n\\nOnce an inputmatrix (matrix_a or matrix_b) is converted to tf32 precision, the combination of\\na fragmentwith precision::tf32 precision, and a data type of float to load_matrix_sync\\nwill take advantage of this new capability. Both the accumulator fragments must have float\\ndata types. The only supported matrix size is 16x16x8 (m-n-k).\\n\\nThe elements of the fragment are represented as float, hence the mapping from ele-\\nment_type<T> to storage_element_type<T> is:\\n\\nprecision::tf32 -> float\\n\\n10.24.3.

Since\\nthe elements of the fragment are packed together, num_storage_elements will be smaller than\\nnum_elements for that fragment. The num_elements variable for a sub-byte fragment, hence re-\\nturns the number of elements of sub-byte type element_type<T>. This is true for single bit preci-\\nsion as well, in which case, the mapping from element_type<T> to storage_element_type<T> is\\nas follows:\\n\\nexperimental::precision::u4 -> unsigned (8 elements in 1 storage element)\\nexperimental::precision::s4 -> int (8 elements in 1 storage element)\\nexperimental::precision::b1 -> unsigned (32 elements in 1 storage element)\\nT -> T ∕∕all other types\\n\\nThe allowed layouts for sub-byte fragments is always row_major for matrix_a and col_major for\\nmatrix_b.\\n\\nFor sub-byte operations the value of ldm in load_matrix_sync should be amultiple of 32 for element\\ntype experimental::precision::u4 and experimental::precision::s4 or a multiple of 128\\nfor element type experimental::precision::b1 (i.e., multiple of 16 bytes in both cases).\\n\\nNote: Support for the following variants for MMA instructions is deprecated and will be removed in\\nsm_90:\\n\\n▶ experimental::precision::u4\\n\\n▶ experimental::precision::s4\\n\\n▶ experimental::precision::b1 with bmmaBitOp set to bmmaBitOpXOR\\n\\nbmma_sync\\nWaits until all warp lanes have executed bmma_sync, and then performs the warp-synchronous\\nbit matrix multiply-accumulate operation D = (A op B) + C, where op consists of a logical op-\\neration bmmaBitOp followed by the accumulation defined by bmmaAccumulateOp. The available\\noperations are:\\n\\nbmmaBitOpXOR, a 128-bit XOR of a row in matrix_a with the 128-bit column of matrix_b\\n\\nbmmaBitOpAND, a 128-bit AND of a row in matrix_awith the 128-bit column of matrix_b, avail-\\nable on devices with compute capability 8.0 and higher.\\n\\nThe accumulate op is always bmmaAccumulateOpPOPC which counts the number of set bits.\\n\\n10.24. Warp Matrix Functions 207\\n\\n\\n\\nCUDA C++ Programming Guide, Release 12.4\\n\\n10.24.5. Restrictions\\n\\nThe special format required by tensor cores may be different for each major and minor device archi-\\ntecture. This is further complicated by threads holding only a fragment (opaque architecture-specific\\nABI data structure) of the overall matrix, with the developer not allowed to make assumptions on how\\nthe individual parameters aremapped to the registers participating in thematrix multiply-accumulate.\\n\\nSince fragments are architecture-specific, it is unsafe to pass them from function A to function B if\\nthe functions have been compiled for different link-compatible architectures and linked together into\\nthe same device executable. In this case, the size and layout of the fragment will be specific to one\\narchitecture and using WMMA APIs in the other will lead to incorrect results or potentially, corruption.\\n\\nAn example of two link-compatible architectures, where the layout of the fragment differs, is sm_70\\nand sm_75.\\n\\nfragA.cu: void foo() { wmma::fragment<...> mat_a; bar(&mat_a); }\\nfragB.cu: void bar(wmma::fragment<...> *mat_a) { ∕∕ operate on mat_a }\\n\\n∕∕ sm_70 fragment layout\\n$> nvcc -dc -arch=compute_70 -code=sm_70 fragA.cu -o fragA.o\\n∕∕ sm_75 fragment layout\\n$> nvcc -dc -arch=compute_75 -code=sm_75 fragB.cu -o fragB.o\\n∕∕ Linking the two together\\n$> nvcc -dlink -arch=sm_75 fragA.o fragB.o -o frag.o\\n\\nThis undefined behavior might also be undetectable at compilation time and by tools at runtime, so\\nextra care is needed to make sure the layout of the fragments is consistent. This linking hazard is\\nmost likely to appear when linking with a legacy library that is both built for a different link-compatible\\narchitecture and expecting to be passed a WMMA fragment.\\n\\nNote that in the case of weak linkages (for example, a CUDAC++ inline function), the linkermay choose\\nany available function definition which may result in implicit passes between compilation units.\\n\\nTo avoid these sorts of problems, thematrix should always be stored out tomemory for transit through\\nexternal interfaces (e.g. wmma::store_matrix_sync(dst, …);) and then it can be safely passed to\\nbar() as a pointer type [e.g. float *dst].\\n\\nNote that since sm_70 can run on sm_75, the above example sm_75 code canbe changed to sm_70 and\\ncorrectly work on sm_75. However, it is recommended to have sm_75 native code in your application\\nwhen linking with other sm_75 separately compiled binaries.\\n\\n10.24.6.

Asynchronous Barrier\\n\\nThe NVIDIA C++ standard library introduces a GPU implementation of std::barrier. Along with the\\nimplementation ofstd::barrier the library provides extensions that allowusers to specify the scope\\nof barrier objects. The barrier API scopes are documented under Thread Scopes. Devices of compute\\ncapability 8.0 or higher provide hardware acceleration for barrier operations and integration of these\\nbarriers with the memcpy_async feature. On devices with compute capability below 8.0 but starting\\n7.0, these barriers are available without hardware acceleration.\\n\\nnvcuda::experimental::awbarrier is deprecated in favor of cuda::barrier.\\n\\n10.26.1. Simple Synchronization Pattern\\n\\nWithout the arrive/wait barrier, synchronization is achieved using __syncthreads() (to synchronize\\nall threads in a block) or group.sync() when using Cooperative Groups.\\n\\n#include <cooperative_groups.h>\\n\\n__global__ void simple_sync(int iteration_count) {\\nauto block = cooperative_groups::this_thread_block();\\n\\nfor (int i = 0; i < iteration_count; ++i) {\\n∕* code before arrive *∕\\nblock.sync(); ∕* wait for all threads to arrive here *∕\\n∕* code after wait *∕\\n\\n}\\n}\\n\\nThreads are blocked at the synchronization point (block.sync()) until all threads have reached the\\nsynchronization point. In addition, memory updates that happened before the synchronization point\\nare guaranteed to be visible to all threads in the block after the synchronization point, i.e., equivalent\\nto atomic_thread_fence(memory_order_seq_cst, thread_scope_block) as well as the sync.\\n\\nThis pattern has three stages:\\n\\n▶ Code before sync performs memory updates that will be read after the sync.\\n\\n▶ Synchronization point\\n\\n▶ Code after sync point with visibility of memory updates that happened before sync point.\\n\\n10.26.2. Temporal Splitting and Five Stages of\\nSynchronization\\n\\nThe temporally-split synchronization pattern with the std::barrier is as follows.\\n\\n#include <cuda∕barrier>\\n#include <cooperative_groups.h>\\n\\n__device__ void compute(float* data, int curr_iteration);\\n\\n(continues on next page)\\n\\n212 Chapter 10.

A thread begins participat-\\ning in a cuda::barrier with its first call to bar.arrive(). When a thread calls bar.\\nwait(std::move(token)) it will be blocked until participating threads have completed bar.\\narrive() the expected number of times as specified by the expected arrival count argument passed\\ntoinit(). Memory updates that happenbefore participating threads’ call tobar.arrive() are guar-\\nanteed to be visible to participating threads after their call to bar.wait(std::move(token)). Note\\nthat the call to bar.arrive() does not block a thread, it can proceed with other work that does not\\ndepend uponmemory updates that happen before other participating threads’ call to bar.arrive().\\n\\nThe arrive and then wait pattern has five stages which may be iteratively repeated:\\n\\n▶ Code before arrive performs memory updates that will be read after the wait.\\n\\n▶ Arrive pointwith implicitmemory fence (i.e., equivalent toatomic_thread_fence(memory_order_seq_cst,\\nthread_scope_block)).\\n\\n▶ Code between arrive and wait.\\n\\n▶ Wait point.\\n\\n▶ Code after the wait, with visibility of updates that were performed before the arrive.\\n\\n10.26.3. Bootstrap Initialization, Expected Arrival Count,\\nand Participation\\n\\nInitialization must happen before any thread begins participating in a cuda::barrier.\\n\\n#include <cuda∕barrier>\\n#include <cooperative_groups.h>\\n\\n__global__ void init_barrier() {\\n__shared__ cuda::barrier<cuda::thread_scope_block> bar;\\n\\n(continues on next page)\\n\\n10.26.

Initialization must happen before any\\nthread calls bar.arrive(). This poses a bootstrapping challenge in that threads must synchronize\\nbefore participating in the cuda::barrier, but threads are creating a cuda::barrier in order to\\nsynchronize. In this example, threads that will participate are part of a cooperative group and use\\nblock.sync() to bootstrap initialization. In this example a whole thread block is participating in\\ninitialization, hence __syncthreads() could also be used.\\n\\nThe second parameter of init() is the expected arrival count, i.e., the number of times bar.\\narrive()will be called by participating threads before a participating thread is unblocked from its call\\nto bar.wait(std::move(token)). In the prior example the cuda::barrier is initialized with the\\nnumber of threads in the thread block i.e., cooperative_groups::this_thread_block().size(),\\nand all threads within the thread block participate in the barrier.\\n\\nA cuda::barrier is flexible in specifying how threads participate (split arrive/wait) and which\\nthreads participate. In contrast this_thread_block.sync() from cooperative groups or __sync-\\nthreads() is applicable to whole-thread-block and __syncwarp(mask) is a specified subset of a\\nwarp. If the intention of the user is to synchronize a full thread block or a full warp we recommend\\nusing __syncthreads() and __syncwarp(mask) respectively for performance reasons.\\n\\n10.26.4. A Barrier’s Phase: Arrival, Countdown,\\nCompletion, and Reset\\n\\nA cuda::barrier counts down from the expected arrival count to zero as participating threads call\\nbar.arrive(). When the countdown reaches zero, a cuda::barrier is complete for the current\\nphase. When the last call to bar.arrive() causes the countdown to reach zero, the countdown is\\nautomatically and atomically reset. The reset assigns the countdown to the expected arrival count,\\nand moves the cuda::barrier to the next phase.\\n\\nAtoken object of classcuda::barrier::arrival_token, as returned fromtoken=bar.arrive(),\\nis associated with the current phase of the barrier. A call to bar.wait(std::move(token)) blocks\\nthe calling thread while the cuda::barrier is in the current phase, i.e., while the phase associated\\nwith the token matches the phase of the cuda::barrier. If the phase is advanced (because the\\ncountdown reaches zero) before the call to bar.wait(std::move(token)) then the thread does\\nnot block; if the phase is advanced while the thread is blocked in bar.wait(std::move(token)),\\nthe thread is unblocked.\\n\\nIt is essential to know when a reset could or could not occur, especially in non-trivial arrive/wait\\nsynchronization patterns.\\n\\n▶ A thread’s calls to token=bar.arrive() and bar.wait(std::move(token)) must be se-\\nquenced such that token=bar.arrive() occurs during the cuda::barrier’s current phase,\\nand bar.wait(std::move(token)) occurs during the same or next phase.\\n\\n214 Chapter 10. C++ Language Extensions\\n\\n\\n\\nCUDA C++ Programming Guide, Release 12.4\\n\\n▶ A thread’s call to bar.arrive() must occur when the barrier’s counter is non-zero. After bar-\\nrier initialization, if a thread’s call to bar.arrive() causes the countdown to reach zero then\\na call to bar.wait(std::move(token)) must happen before the barrier can be reused for a\\nsubsequent call to bar.arrive().\\n\\n▶ bar.wait() must only be called using a token object of the current phase or the immediately\\npreceding phase. For any other values of the token object, the behavior is undefined.\\n\\nFor simple arrive/wait synchronization patterns, compliance with these usage rules is straightforward.\\n\\n10.26.5. Spatial Partitioning (also known as Warp\\nSpecialization)\\n\\nA thread block can be spatially partitioned such that warps are specialized to perform independent\\ncomputations. Spatial partitioning is used in a producer or consumer pattern, where one subset of\\nthreads produces data that is concurrently consumed by the other (disjoint) subset of threads.\\n\\nA producer/consumer spatial partitioning pattern requires two one sided synchronizations to manage\\na data buffer between the producer and consumer.\\n\\nProducer Consumer\\n\\nwait for buffer to be ready to be filled signal buffer is ready to be filled\\n\\nproduce data and fill the buffer\\n\\nsignal buffer is filled wait for buffer to be filled\\n\\nconsume data in filled buffer\\n\\nProducer threads wait for consumer threads to signal that the buffer is ready to be filled; how-\\never, consumer threads do not wait for this signal. Consumer threads wait for producer threads to\\nsignal that the buffer is filled; however, producer threads do not wait for this signal.

Early Exit (Dropping out of Participation)\\n\\nWhen a thread that is participating in a sequence of synchronizations must exit early from that se-\\nquence, that thread must explicitly drop out of participation before exiting.

Without memcpy_async\\n\\nWithout memcpy_async, the copy phase of the copy and compute pattern is expressed as\\nshared[local_idx] = global[global_idx]. This global to shared memory copy is expanded\\nto a read from global memory into a register, followed by a write to shared memory from the register.\\n\\nWhen this pattern occurs within an iterative algorithm, each thread block needs to synchronize af-\\nter the shared[local_idx] = global[global_idx] assignment, to ensure all writes to shared\\nmemory have completed before the compute phase can begin. The thread block also needs to syn-\\nchronize again after the compute phase, to prevent overwriting sharedmemory before all threads have\\ncompleted their computations. This pattern is illustrated in the following code snippet.\\n\\n#include <cooperative_groups.h>\\n__device__ void compute(int* global_out, int const* shared_in) {\\n\\n∕∕ Computes using all values of current batch from shared memory.\\n∕∕ Stores this thread\\'s result back to global memory.\\n\\n}\\n\\n__global__ void without_memcpy_async(int* global_out, int const* global_in, size_t�\\n↪→size, size_t batch_sz) {\\nauto grid = cooperative_groups::this_grid();\\nauto block = cooperative_groups::this_thread_block();\\nassert(size == batch_sz * grid.size()); ∕∕ Exposition: input size fits batch_sz *�\\n\\n↪→grid_size\\n\\nextern __shared__ int shared[]; ∕∕ block.size() * sizeof(int) bytes\\n\\nsize_t local_idx = block.thread_rank();\\n\\nfor (size_t batch = 0; batch < batch_sz; ++batch) {\\n∕∕ Compute the index of the current batch for this block in global memory:\\nsize_t block_batch_idx = block.group_index().x * block.size() + grid.size() *�\\n\\n↪→batch;\\nsize_t global_idx = block_batch_idx + threadIdx.x;\\nshared[local_idx] = global_in[global_idx];\\n\\nblock.sync(); ∕∕ Wait for all copies to complete\\n\\ncompute(global_out + block_batch_idx, shared); ∕∕ Compute and write result to�\\n↪→global memory\\n\\nblock.sync(); ∕∕ Wait for compute using shared memory to finish\\n}\\n\\n}\\n\\n10.27.

Performance Guidance for memcpy_async\\n\\nFor compute capability 8.x, the pipeline mechanism is shared among CUDA threads in the same CUDA\\nwarp.

Please\\nrefer to the Pipeline Interface and the Pipeline Primitives Interface for an overview of the individual\\noperations.\\n\\n10.27.6.1 Alignment\\n\\nOn devices with compute capability 8.0, the cp.async family of instructions allows copying data from\\nglobal to shared memory asynchronously. These instructions support copying 4, 8, and 16 bytes at\\na time. If the size provided to memcpy_async is a multiple of 4, 8, or 16, and both pointers passed\\nto memcpy_async are aligned to a 4, 8, or 16 alignment boundary, then memcpy_async can be imple-\\nmented using exclusively asynchronous memory operations.\\n\\nAdditionally for achieving best performancewhenusingmemcpy_asyncAPI, an alignment of 128Bytes\\nfor both shared memory and global memory is required.\\n\\nFor pointers to values of types with an alignment requirement of 1 or 2, it is often not possible to prove\\nthat the pointers are always aligned to a higher alignment boundary. Determining whether the cp.\\nasync instructions can or cannot be used must be delayed until run-time. Performing such a runtime\\nalignment check increases code-size and adds runtime overhead.\\n\\nThe cuda::aligned_size_t<size_t Align>(size_t size)Shape can be used to supply a proof that both point-\\ners passed to memcpy_async are aligned to an Align alignment boundary and that size is a multiple\\nof Align, by passing it as an argument where the memcpy_async APIs expect a Shape:\\n\\ncuda::memcpy_async(group, dst, src, cuda::aligned_size_t<16>(N * block.size()),�\\n↪→pipeline);\\n\\nIf the proof is incorrect, the behavior is undefined.\\n\\n10.27.6.2 Trivially copyable\\n\\nOn devices with compute capability 8.0, the cp.async family of instructions allows copying data from\\nglobal to shared memory asynchronously. If the pointer types passed to memcpy_async do not point\\nto TriviallyCopyable types, the copy constructor of each output element needs to be invoked, and these\\ninstructions cannot be used to accelerate memcpy_async.\\n\\n10.27.6.3 Warp Entanglement - Commit\\n\\nThe sequence of memcpy_async batches is shared across thewarp.

Asynchronous Data Copies using Tensor\\nMemory Access (TMA)\\n\\nMany applications require movement of large amounts of data from and to global memory. Often, the\\ndata is laid out in global memory as amulti-dimensional array with non-sequential data acess patterns.\\nTo reduce global memory usage, sub-tiles of such arrays are copied to shared memory before use in\\ncomputations. The loading and storing involves addreses-calculations that can be error-prone and\\nrepetitive. To offload these computations, Compute Capability 9.0 introduces Tensor Memory Acces\\n(TMA). The primary goal of TMA is to provide an efficient data transfermechanism fromglobalmemory\\nto shared memory for multi-dimensional arrays.\\n\\nNaming. Tensor memory access (TMA) is a broad term used to market the features described in this\\nsection. For the purpose of forward-compatibility and to reduce discrepancies with the PTX ISA, the\\ntext in this section refers to TMA operations as either bulk-asynchronous copies or bulk tensor asyn-\\nchronous copies, depending on the specific type of copy used. The term “bulk” is used to contrast\\nthese operations with the asynchronous memory operations described in the previous sections.\\n\\nDimensions. TMA supports copying both one-dimensional and multi-dimensional arrays (up to 5-\\ndimensional). The programming model for bulk-asynchronous copies of one-dimensional contigu-\\nous arrays is different from the programming model for bulk tensor asynchronous copies of multi-\\ndimensional arrays. To perform a bulk tensor asynchronous copy of a multi-dimensional array, the\\nhardware requires a tensor map. This object describes the layout of the multi-dimensional array\\nin global and shared memory. A tensor map is created on the host using the cuTensorMapEncode\\nAPI. The tensor map is transferred from host to device as a const kernel parameter annotated with\\n__grid_constant__, and can be used on the device to copy a tile of data between shared and global\\nmemory. In contrast, performing a bulk-asynchronous copy of a contiguous one-dimensional array\\ndoes not require a tensor map: it can be performed on-device with a pointer and size parameter.\\n\\nSource and destination. The source and destination addresses of bulk-asynchronous copy operations\\ncan be in shared or global memory. The operations can read data from global to shared memory, write\\ndata from shared to global memory, and also copy from sharedmemory to Distributed SharedMemory\\nof another block in the same cluster. In addition, when in a cluster, a bulk-asynchronous operation can\\nbe specified as beingmulticast. In this case, data can be transferred fromglobalmemory to the shared\\nmemory ofmultiple blockswithin the cluster. Themulticast feature is optimized for target architecture\\nsm_90a and may have significantly reduced performance on other targets. Hence, it is advised to be\\nused with compute architecture sm_90a.\\n\\nAsynchronous. Data transfers using TMA are asynchronous. This allows the initiating thread to con-\\ntinue computing while the hardware asynchronously copies the data. Whether the data transfer oc-\\ncurs asynchronously in practice is up to the hardware implementation andmay change in the future.\\nThere are several completion mechanisms that bulk-asynchronous operations can use to signal that\\n\\n10.29.

When the operation reads from global to shared memory, any thread in the\\nblock can wait for the data to be readable in shared memory by waiting on a Shared Memory Bar-\\nrier. When the bulk-asynchronous operation writes data from shared memory to global or distributed\\nshared memory, only the initiating thread can wait for the operation to have completed. This is ac-\\ncomplished using a bulk async-group based completionmechanism. A table describing the completion\\nmechanisms can be found below and in the PTX ISA.\\n\\nTable 6: Asynchronous copies with possible source and des-\\ntinations memory spaces and completion mechanisms.

The bulk-asynchronous copy instruction directs the hardware to copy a large chunk of\\ndata into shared memory, and to update the transaction count of the shared memory barrier after\\ncompleting the read. In general, issuing as few bulk copies with as big a size as possible results in\\nthe best performance. Because the copy can be performed asynchronously by the hardware, it is not\\nnecessary to split the copy into smaller chunks.\\n\\nThe thread that initiates the bulk-asynchronous copy operation arrives at the barrier using mbarrier.\\narrive.expect_tx. This tells the barrier that the thread has arrived and also how many bytes (tx /\\ntransactions) are expected to arrive. Only a single thread has to update the expected transaction\\ncount. If multiple threads update the transaction count, the expected transaction will be the sum of\\nthe updates. The barrier will only flip once all threads have arrived and all bytes have arrived. Once the\\nbarrier has flipped, the bytes are safe to read from shared memory, both by the threads as well as by\\nsubsequent bulk-asynchronous copies. More information about barrier transaction accounting can be\\nfound in the PTX ISA.\\n\\nBarrier wait. Waiting for the barrier to flip is done using mbarrier.try_wait. It can either return\\ntrue, indicating that the wait is over, or return false, which may mean that the wait timed out. The\\nwhile loop waits for completion, and retries on time-out.\\n\\nSMEMwrite and sync. The increment of the buffer values reads andwrites to sharedmemory. Tomake\\nthe writes visible to subsequent bulk-asynchronous copies, the fence.proxy.async.shared::cta\\ninstruction is used. This orders the writes to shared memory before subsequent reads from bulk-\\nasynchronous copy operations, which read through the async proxy. So each thread first orders the\\nwrites to objects in shared memory in the async proxy via the fence.proxy.async.shared::cta,\\nand these operations by all threads are ordered before the async operation performed in thread 0\\nusing __syncthreads().\\n\\nTMAwrite and sync. The write from shared to global memory is again initiated by a single thread. The\\ncompletion of the write is not tracked by a shared memory barrier. Instead, a thread-local mechanism\\nis used. Multiple writes can be batched into a so-called bulk async-group. Afterwards, the thread can\\nwait for all operations in this group to have completed reading from shared memory (as in the code\\nabove) or to have completedwriting to globalmemory, making thewrites visible to the initiating thread.\\nFor more information, refer to the PTX ISA documentation of cp.async.bulk.wait_group. Note that the\\nbulk-asynchronous and non-bulk asynchronous copy instructions have different async-groups: there\\nexist both cp.async.wait_group and cp.async.bulk.wait_group instructions.\\n\\nThe bulk-asynchronous instructions have specific alignment requirements on their source and desti-\\nnation addresses.

Multiple versions of the output\\nstring will then appear at the host stream, once for each thread which encountered the printf().\\n\\nIt is up to the programmer to limit the output to a single thread if only a single output string is desired\\n(see Examples for an illustrative example).\\n\\nUnlike the C-standard printf(), which returns the number of characters printed, CUDA’s printf()\\nreturns the number of arguments parsed. If no arguments follow the format string, 0 is returned. If\\nthe format string is NULL, -1 is returned. If an internal error occurs, -2 is returned.\\n\\n10.34.1. Format Specifiers\\n\\nAs for standard printf(), format specifiers take the form: %[flags][width][.\\nprecision][size]type\\n\\nThe following fields are supported (see widely-available documentation for a complete description of\\nall behaviors):\\n\\n▶ Flags: \\'#\\' \\' \\' \\'0\\' \\'+\\' \\'-\\'\\n\\n▶ Width: \\'*\\' \\'0-9\\'\\n\\n▶ Precision: \\'0-9\\'\\n\\n▶ Size: \\'h\\' \\'l\\' \\'ll\\'\\n\\n▶ Type: \"%cdiouxXpeEfgGaAs\"\\n\\nNote that CUDA’s printf()will accept any combination of flag, width, precision, size and type,\\nwhether or not overall they form a valid format specifier. In other words, “%hd” will be accepted and\\nprintf will expect a double-precision variable in the corresponding location in the argument list.\\n\\n10.34.2. Limitations\\n\\nFinal formatting of the printf()output takes place on the host system. This means that the format\\nstring must be understood by the host-system’s compiler and C library. Every effort has beenmade to\\nensure that the format specifiers supported by CUDA’s printf function form a universal subset from\\nthe most common host compilers, but exact behavior will be host-OS-dependent.\\n\\nAs described in Format Specifiers, printf()will accept all combinations of valid flags and types. This\\nis because it cannot determine what will and will not be valid on the host systemwhere the final output\\nis formatted. The effect of this is that output may be undefined if the program emits a format string\\nwhich contains invalid combinations.\\n\\nThe printf() command can accept atmost 32 arguments in addition to the format string. Additional\\narguments beyond this will be ignored, and the format specifier output as-is.\\n\\nOwing to the differing size of the long type on 64-bit Windows platforms (four bytes on 64-bit Win-\\ndows platforms, eight bytes on other 64-bit platforms), a kernel which is compiled on a non-Windows\\n64-bit machine but then run on a win64machine will see corrupted output for all format strings which\\n\\n248 Chapter 10. C++ Language Extensions\\n\\nindex.html#examples-per-thread\\nindex.html#format-specifiers\\n\\n\\nCUDA C++ Programming Guide, Release 12.4\\n\\ninclude “%ld”. It is recommended that the compilation platform matches the execution platform to\\nensure safety.\\n\\nThe output buffer for printf() is set to a fixed size before kernel launch (see Associated Host-Side\\nAPI). It is circular and if more output is produced during kernel execution than can fit in the buffer,\\nolder output is overwritten. It is flushed only when one of these actions is performed:\\n\\n▶ Kernel launch via <<<>>> or cuLaunchKernel() (at the start of the launch, and if the\\nCUDA_LAUNCH_BLOCKING environment variable is set to 1, at the end of the launch as well),\\n\\n▶ Synchronization via cudaDeviceSynchronize(), cuCtxSynchronize(), cudaStreamSyn-\\nchronize(), cuStreamSynchronize(), cudaEventSynchronize(), or cuEventSynchro-\\nnize(),\\n\\n▶ Memory copies via any blocking version of cudaMemcpy*() or cuMemcpy*(),\\n\\n▶ Module loading/unloading via cuModuleLoad() or cuModuleUnload(),\\n\\n▶ Context destruction via cudaDeviceReset() or cuCtxDestroy().\\n\\n▶ Prior to executing a stream callback added by cudaStreamAddCallback or cuStreamAddCall-\\nback.\\n\\nNote that the buffer is not flushed automatically when the program exits. The user must call cudaDe-\\nviceReset() or cuCtxDestroy() explicitly, as shown in the examples below.\\n\\nInternally printf() uses a shared data structure and so it is possible that calling printf() might\\nchange the order of execution of threads. In particular, a thread which calls printf() might take a\\nlonger execution path than onewhich does not call printf(), and that path length is dependent upon\\nthe parameters of the printf(). Note, however, that CUDAmakes no guarantees of thread execution\\norder except at explicit __syncthreads() barriers, so it is impossible to tell whether execution order\\nhas been modified by printf() or by other scheduling behavior in the hardware.\\n\\n10.34.3. Associated Host-Side API\\n\\nThe following API functions get and set the size of the buffer used to transfer the printf() argu-\\nments and internal metadata to the host (default is 1 megabyte):\\n\\n▶ cudaDeviceGetLimit(size_t* size,cudaLimitPrintfFifoSize)\\n\\n▶ cudaDeviceSetLimit(cudaLimitPrintfFifoSize, size_t size)\\n\\n10.34.4. Examples\\n\\nThe following code sample:\\n\\n#include <stdio.h>\\n\\n__global__ void helloCUDA(float f)\\n{\\n\\nprintf(\"Hello thread %d, f=%f\\\\n\", threadIdx.x, f);\\n}\\n\\nint main()\\n{\\n\\n(continues on next page)\\n\\n10.34.

The address of the allocated memory will be a multiple of\\nalign. alignmust be a non-zero power of 2.\\n\\nThe CUDA in-kernel free() function deallocates the memory pointed to by ptr, which must have\\nbeen returned by a previous call to malloc() or __nv_aligned_device_malloc(). If ptr is NULL,\\nthe call to free() is ignored. Repeated calls to free() with the same ptr has undefined behavior.\\n\\nThe memory allocated by a given CUDA thread via malloc() or __nv_aligned_device_malloc()\\nremains allocated for the lifetime of the CUDA context, or until it is explicitly released by a call to\\nfree(). It can be used by any other CUDA threads even from subsequent kernel launches. Any CUDA\\nthread may free memory allocated by another thread, but care should be taken to ensure that the\\nsame pointer is not freed more than once.\\n\\n10.35.1. Heap Memory Allocation\\n\\nThe device memory heap has a fixed size that must be specified before any program using malloc(),\\n__nv_aligned_device_malloc() or free() is loaded into the context. A default heap of eight\\nmegabytes is allocated if any program uses malloc() or __nv_aligned_device_malloc()without\\nexplicitly specifying the heap size.\\n\\nThe following API functions get and set the heap size:\\n\\n▶ cudaDeviceGetLimit(size_t* size, cudaLimitMallocHeapSize)\\n\\n▶ cudaDeviceSetLimit(cudaLimitMallocHeapSize, size_t size)\\n\\nThe heap size granted will be at least size bytes. cuCtxGetLimit()and cudaDeviceGetLimit()\\nreturn the currently requested heap size.\\n\\nThe actual memory allocation for the heap occurs when a module is loaded into the con-\\ntext, either explicitly via the CUDA driver API (see Module), or implicitly via the CUDA run-\\ntime API (see CUDA Runtime). If the memory allocation fails, the module load will generate a\\nCUDA_ERROR_SHARED_OBJECT_INIT_FAILED error.\\n\\nHeap size cannot be changed once a module load has occurred and it does not resize dynamically\\naccording to need.\\n\\nMemory reserved for the device heap is in addition to memory allocated through host-side CUDA API\\ncalls such as cudaMalloc().\\n\\n10.35.

Execution Configuration\\n\\nAny call to a __global__ functionmust specify the execution configuration for that call. The execution\\nconfiguration defines the dimension of the grid and blocks that will be used to execute the function\\non the device, as well as the associated stream (see CUDA Runtime for a description of streams).\\n\\nThe execution configuration is specified by inserting an expression of the form <<< Dg, Db, Ns, S\\n>>> between the function name and the parenthesized argument list, where:\\n\\n▶ Dg is of type dim3 (see dim3) and specifies the dimension and size of the grid, such that Dg.x *\\nDg.y * Dg.z equals the number of blocks being launched;\\n\\n▶ Db is of type dim3 (see dim3) and specifies the dimension and size of each block, such that Db.x\\n* Db.y * Db.z equals the number of threads per block;\\n\\n▶ Ns is of type size_t and specifies the number of bytes in shared memory that is dynamically\\nallocated per block for this call in addition to the statically allocated memory; this dynamically\\nallocated memory is used by any of the variables declared as an external array as mentioned in\\n__shared__; Ns is an optional argument which defaults to 0;\\n\\n▶ S is of type cudaStream_t and specifies the associated stream; S is an optional argument which\\ndefaults to 0.\\n\\nAs an example, a function declared as\\n\\n__global__ void Func(float* parameter);\\n\\nmust be called like this:\\n\\nFunc<<< Dg, Db, Ns >>>(parameter);\\n\\nThe arguments to the execution configuration are evaluated before the actual function arguments.\\n\\nThe function call will fail if Dg or Db are greater than the maximum sizes allowed for the device as\\nspecified in Compute Capabilities, or if Ns is greater than the maximum amount of shared memory\\navailable on the device, minus the amount of shared memory required for static allocation.\\n\\nCompute capability 9.0 and above allows users to specify compile time thread block cluster dimen-\\nsions, so that the kernel can use the cluster hierarchy in CUDA. Compile time cluster dimension can\\nbe specified using __cluster_dims__([x, [y, [z]]]). The example below shows compile time\\ncluster size of 2 in X dimension and 1 in Y and Z dimension.\\n\\n__global__ void __cluster_dims__(2, 1, 1) Func(float* parameter);\\n\\nThread block cluster dimensions can also be specified at runtime and kernel with the cluster can be\\nlaunched using cudaLaunchKernelEx API.

Launch Bounds\\n\\nAs discussed in detail in Multiprocessor Level, the fewer registers a kernel uses, the more threads and\\nthread blocks are likely to reside on a multiprocessor, which can improve performance.\\n\\nTherefore, the compiler uses heuristics to minimize register usage while keeping register spilling (see\\nDeviceMemory Accesses) and instruction count to aminimum. An application can optionally aid these\\nheuristics by providing additional information to the compiler in the form of launch bounds that are\\nspecified using the __launch_bounds__() qualifier in the definition of a __global__ function:\\n\\n__global__ void\\n__launch_bounds__(maxThreadsPerBlock, minBlocksPerMultiprocessor, maxBlocksPerCluster)\\nMyKernel(...)\\n{\\n\\n...\\n}\\n\\n▶ maxThreadsPerBlock specifies the maximum number of threads per block with which the ap-\\nplication will ever launch MyKernel(); it compiles to the .maxntidPTX directive.\\n\\n▶ minBlocksPerMultiprocessor is optional and specifies the desired minimum number of res-\\nident blocks per multiprocessor; it compiles to the .minnctapersmPTX directive.\\n\\n▶ maxBlocksPerCluster is optional and specifies the desired maximum number thread blocks\\nper cluster with which the application will ever launch MyKernel(); it compiles to the .\\nmaxclusterrankPTX directive.\\n\\nIf launch bounds are specified, the compiler first derives from them the upper limit L on the number\\nof registers the kernel should use to ensure that minBlocksPerMultiprocessor blocks (or a sin-\\ngle block if minBlocksPerMultiprocessor is not specified) of maxThreadsPerBlock threads can\\nreside on the multiprocessor (see Hardware Multithreading for the relationship between the number\\nof registers used by a kernel and the number of registers allocated per block). The compiler then\\noptimizes register usage in the following way:\\n\\n▶ If the initial register usage is higher than L, the compiler reduces it further until it becomes less\\nor equal to L, usually at the expense of more local memory usage and/or higher number of in-\\nstructions;\\n\\n256 Chapter 10. C++ Language Extensions\\n\\nindex.html#multiprocessor-level\\nindex.html#device-memory-accesses\\nindex.html#hardware-multithreading\\n\\n\\nCUDA C++ Programming Guide, Release 12.4\\n\\n▶ If the initial register usage is lower than L\\n\\n▶ If maxThreadsPerBlock is specified and minBlocksPerMultiprocessor is not, the com-\\npiler uses maxThreadsPerBlock to determine the register usage thresholds for the tran-\\nsitions between n and n+1 resident blocks (i.e., when using one less register makes room\\nfor an additional resident block as in the example of Multiprocessor Level) and then applies\\nsimilar heuristics as when no launch bounds are specified;\\n\\n▶ If both minBlocksPerMultiprocessor and maxThreadsPerBlock are specified, the\\ncompiler may increase register usage as high as L to reduce the number of instructions\\nand better hide single thread instruction latency.\\n\\nA kernel will fail to launch if it is executed with more threads per block than its launch bound max-\\nThreadsPerBlock.\\n\\nA kernel will fail to launch if it is executed with more thread blocks per cluster than its launch bound\\nmaxBlocksPerCluster.\\n\\nPer thread resources required by a CUDA kernel might limit the maximum block size in an un-\\nwanted way. In order to maintain forward compatibility to future hardware and toolkits and to\\nensure that at least one thread block can run on an SM, developers should include the single ar-\\ngument __launch_bounds__(maxThreadsPerBlock) which specifies the largest block size that\\nthe kernel will be launched with. Failure to do so could lead to “too many resources requested for\\nlaunch” errors. Providing the two argument version of __launch_bounds__(maxThreadsPerBlock,\\nminBlocksPerMultiprocessor) can improve performance in some cases. The right value for min-\\nBlocksPerMultiprocessor should be determined using a detailed per kernel analysis.\\n\\nOptimal launch bounds for a given kernel will usually differ across major architecture revisions. The\\nsample code below shows how this is typically handled in device code using the __CUDA_ARCH__macro\\nintroduced in Application Compatibility\\n\\n#define THREADS_PER_BLOCK 256\\n#if __CUDA_ARCH__ >= 200\\n\\n#define MY_KERNEL_MAX_THREADS (2 * THREADS_PER_BLOCK)\\n#define MY_KERNEL_MIN_BLOCKS 3\\n\\n#else\\n#define MY_KERNEL_MAX_THREADS THREADS_PER_BLOCK\\n#define MY_KERNEL_MIN_BLOCKS 2\\n\\n#endif\\n\\n∕∕ Device code\\n__global__ void\\n__launch_bounds__(MY_KERNEL_MAX_THREADS, MY_KERNEL_MIN_BLOCKS)\\nMyKernel(...)\\n{\\n\\n...\\n}\\n\\nIn the common case where MyKernel is invoked with the maximum number of threads per\\nblock (specified as the first parameter of __launch_bounds__()), it is tempting to use\\nMY_KERNEL_MAX_THREADS as the number of threads per block in the execution configuration:\\n\\n∕∕ Host code\\nMyKernel<<<blocksPerGrid, MY_KERNEL_MAX_THREADS>>>(...);\\n\\nThis will not work however since __CUDA_ARCH__ is undefined in host code as mentioned in Applica-\\ntion Compatibility, so MyKernel will launch with 256 threads per block even when __CUDA_ARCH__ is\\ngreater or equal to 200.

C++ Language Extensions\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 11. Cooperative Groups\\n\\n11.1. Introduction\\n\\nCooperative Groups is an extension to the CUDA programming model, introduced in CUDA 9, for orga-\\nnizing groups of communicating threads. Cooperative Groups allows developers to express the gran-\\nularity at which threads are communicating, helping them to express richer, more efficient parallel\\ndecompositions.\\n\\nHistorically, the CUDA programming model has provided a single, simple construct for synchronizing\\ncooperating threads: a barrier across all threads of a thread block, as implemented with the __sync-\\nthreads() intrinsic function. However, programmers would like to define and synchronize groups\\nof threads at other granularities to enable greater performance, design flexibility, and software reuse\\nin the form of “collective” group-wide function interfaces. In an effort to express broader patterns\\nof parallel interaction, many performance-oriented programmers have resorted to writing their own\\nad hoc and unsafe primitives for synchronizing threads within a single warp, or across sets of thread\\nblocks running on a single GPU.Whilst the performance improvements achieved have often been valu-\\nable, this has resulted in an ever-growing collection of brittle code that is expensive to write, tune, and\\nmaintain over time and across GPU generations. Cooperative Groups addresses this by providing a\\nsafe and future-proof mechanism to enable performant code.\\n\\n11.2. What’s New in Cooperative Groups\\n\\n11.2.1. CUDA 12.2\\n\\n▶ barrier_arrive and barrier_wait member functions were added for grid_group and\\nthread_block. Description of the API is available here.\\n\\n263\\n\\nindex.html#grid-group\\nindex.html#thread-block-group\\nindex.html#barrier-arrive-and-barrier-wait\\n\\n\\nCUDA C++ Programming Guide, Release 12.4\\n\\n11.2.2. CUDA 12.1\\n\\n▶ invoke_one and invoke_one_broadcast APIs were added.\\n\\n11.2.3. CUDA 12.0\\n\\n▶ The following experimental APIs are now moved to the main namespace:\\n\\n▶ asynchronous reduce and scan update added in CUDA 11.7\\n\\n▶ thread_block_tile larger than 32 added in CUDA 11.1\\n\\n▶ It is no longer required to provide memory using the block_tile_memory object in order to\\ncreate these large tiles on Compute Capability 8.0 or higher.\\n\\n11.3. Programming Model Concept\\n\\nThe Cooperative Groups programming model describes synchronization patterns both within and\\nacross CUDA thread blocks. It provides both the means for applications to define their own groups\\nof threads, and the interfaces to synchronize them. It also provides new launch APIs that enforce\\ncertain restrictions and therefore can guarantee the synchronization will work. These primitives en-\\nable new patterns of cooperative parallelism within CUDA, including producer-consumer parallelism,\\nopportunistic parallelism, and global synchronization across the entire Grid.\\n\\nThe Cooperative Groups programming model consists of the following elements:\\n\\n▶ Data types for representing groups of cooperating threads;\\n\\n▶ Operations to obtain implicit groups defined by the CUDA launch API (e.g., thread blocks);\\n\\n▶ Collectives for partitioning existing groups into new groups;\\n\\n▶ Collective Algorithms for data movement and manipulation (e.g. memcpy_async, reduce, scan);\\n\\n▶ An operation to synchronize all threads within the group;\\n\\n▶ Operations to inspect the group properties;\\n\\n▶ Collectives that expose low-level, group-specific and often HW accelerated, operations.\\n\\nThe main concept in Cooperative Groups is that of objects naming the set of threads that are part of\\nit. This expression of groups as first-class program objects improves software composition, since col-\\nlective functions can receive an explicit object representing the group of participating threads. This\\nobject also makes programmer intent explicit, which eliminates unsound architectural assumptions\\nthat result in brittle code, undesirable restrictions upon compiler optimizations, and better compati-\\nbility with new GPU generations.\\n\\nTo write efficient code, its best to use specialized groups (going generic loses a lot of compile time op-\\ntimizations), and pass these group objects by reference to functions that intend to use these threads\\nin some cooperative fashion.\\n\\nCooperative Groups requires CUDA 9.0 or later. To use Cooperative Groups, include the header file:\\n\\n264 Chapter 11. Cooperative Groups\\n\\nindex.html#invoke-one-and-invoke-one-broadcast\\n\\n\\nCUDA C++ Programming Guide, Release 12.4\\n\\n∕∕ Primary header is compatible with pre-C++11, collective algorithm headers require�\\n↪→C++11\\n#include <cooperative_groups.h>\\n∕∕ Optionally include for memcpy_async() collective\\n#include <cooperative_groups∕memcpy_async.h>\\n∕∕ Optionally include for reduce() collective\\n#include <cooperative_groups∕reduce.h>\\n∕∕ Optionally include for inclusive_scan() and exclusive_scan() collectives\\n#include <cooperative_groups∕scan.h>\\n\\nand use the Cooperative Groups namespace:\\n\\nusing namespace cooperative_groups;\\n∕∕ Alternatively use an alias to avoid polluting the namespace with collective�\\n↪→algorithms\\nnamespace cg = cooperative_groups;\\n\\nThe code can be compiled in a normal way using nvcc, however if you wish to use memcpy_async,\\nreduce or scan functionality and your host compiler’s default dialect is not C++11 or higher, then you\\nmust add --std=c++11 to the command line.\\n\\n11.3.1. Composition Example\\n\\nTo illustrate the concept of groups, this example attempts to perform a block-wide sum reduction.\\nPreviously, there were hidden constraints on the implementation when writing this code:\\n\\n__device__ int sum(int *x, int n) {\\n∕∕ ...\\n__syncthreads();\\nreturn total;\\n\\n}\\n\\n__global__ void parallel_kernel(float *x) {\\n∕∕ ...\\n∕∕ Entire thread block must call sum\\nsum(x, n);\\n\\n}\\n\\nAll threads in the thread block must arrive at the __syncthreads() barrier, however, this constraint\\nis hidden from the developer who might want to use sum(…). With Cooperative Groups, a better way\\nof writing this would be:\\n\\n__device__ int sum(const thread_block& g, int *x, int n) {\\n∕∕ ...\\ng.sync()\\nreturn total;\\n\\n}\\n\\n__global__ void parallel_kernel(...) {\\n∕∕ ...\\n∕∕ Entire thread block must call sum\\nthread_block tb = this_thread_block();\\nsum(tb, x, n);\\n∕∕ ...\\n\\n}\\n\\n11.3. Programming Model Concept 265\\n\\n\\n\\nCUDA C++ Programming Guide, Release 12.4\\n\\n11.4. Group Types\\n\\n11.4.1. Implicit Groups\\n\\nImplicit groups represent the launch configuration of the kernel. Regardless of how your kernel is\\nwritten, it always has a set number of threads, blocks and block dimensions, a single grid and grid\\ndimensions. In addition, if the multi-device cooperative launch API is used, it can have multiple grids\\n(single grid per device). These groups provide a starting point for decomposition into finer grained\\ngroups which are typically HW accelerated and are more specialized for the problem the developer is\\nsolving.\\n\\nAlthough you can create an implicit group anywhere in the code, it is dangerous to do so. Creating a\\nhandle for an implicit group is a collective operation—all threads in the group must participate. If the\\ngroup was created in a conditional branch that not all threads reach, this can lead to deadlocks or data\\ncorruption. For this reason, it is recommended that you create a handle for the implicit group upfront\\n(as early as possible, before any branching has occurred) and use that handle throughout the kernel.\\nGroup handles must be initialized at declaration time (there is no default constructor) for the same\\nreason and copy-constructing them is discouraged.\\n\\n11.4.1.1 Thread Block Group\\n\\nAny CUDA programmer is already familiar with a certain group of threads: the thread block. The Co-\\noperative Groups extension introduces a new datatype, thread_block, to explicitly represent this\\nconcept within the kernel.\\n\\nclass thread_block;\\n\\nConstructed via:\\n\\nthread_block g = this_thread_block();\\n\\nPublic Member Functions:\\n\\nstatic void sync(): Synchronize the threads named in the group, equivalent to g.\\nbarrier_wait(g.barrier_arrive())\\n\\nthread_block::arrival_token barrier_arrive(): Arrive on the thread_block barrier, returns\\na token that needs to be passed into barrier_wait().

Group Collectives\\n\\nCooperative Groups library provides a set of collective operations that can be performed by a group of\\nthreads. These operations require participation of all threads in the specified group in order to com-\\nplete the operation. All threads in the group need to pass the same values for corresponding argu-\\nments to each collective call, unless different values are explicitly allowed in the argument description.\\nOtherwise the behavior of the call is undefined.\\n\\n11.6.1. Synchronization\\n\\n11.6.1.1 barrier_arrive and barrier_wait\\n\\nT::arrival_token T::barrier_arrive();\\nvoid T::barrier_wait(T::arrival_token&&);\\n\\nbarrier_arrive and barrier_wait member functions provide a synchronization API similar to\\ncuda::barrier (readmore). Cooperative Groups automatically initializes the group barrier, but arrive\\nand wait operations have an additional restriction resulting from collective nature of those operations:\\nAll threads in the group must arrive and wait at the barrier once per phase. When barrier_arrive\\nis called with a group, result of calling any collective operation or another barrier arrival with that\\ngroup is undefined until completion of the barrier phase is observed with barrier_wait call. Threads\\nblocked on barrier_waitmight be released from the synchronization before other threads call bar-\\nrier_wait, but only after all threads in the group called barrier_arrive. Group type T can be any\\nof the implicit groups .This allows threads to do independent work after they arrive and before they\\nwait for the synchronization to resolve, allowing to hide some of the synchronization latency. bar-\\nrier_arrive returns an arrival_token object that must be passed into the corresponding bar-\\nrier_wait. Token is consumed this way and can not be used for another barrier_wait call.\\n\\nExample of barrier_arrive and barrier_wait used to synchronize initization of shared memory across\\nthe cluster:\\n\\n#include <cooperative_groups.h>\\n\\nusing namespace cooperative_groups;\\n\\nvoid __device__ init_shared_data(const thread_block& block, int *data);\\nvoid __device__ local_processing(const thread_block& block);\\nvoid __device__ process_shared_data(const thread_block& block, int *data);\\n\\n__global__ void cluster_kernel() {\\nextern __shared__ int array[];\\n\\n(continues on next page)\\n\\n276 Chapter 11.

Data Transfer\\n\\n11.6.2.1 memcpy_async\\n\\nmemcpy_async is a group-wide collective memcpy that utilizes hardware accelerated support for non-\\nblocking memory transactions from global to shared memory. Given a set of threads named in the\\ngroup, memcpy_async will move specified amount of bytes or elements of the input type through a\\nsingle pipeline stage. Additionally for achieving best performance when using the memcpy_async API,\\nan alignment of 16 bytes for both shared memory and global memory is required. It is important to\\nnote that while this is a memcpy in the general case, it is only asynchronous if the source is global\\nmemory and the destination is shared memory and both can be addressed with 16, 8, or 4 byte align-\\nments. Asynchronously copied data should only be read following a call to wait or wait_prior which\\nsignals that the corresponding stage has completed moving data to shared memory.\\n\\n11.6. Group Collectives 277\\n\\n\\n\\nCUDA C++ Programming Guide, Release 12.4\\n\\nHaving to wait on all outstanding requests can lose some flexibility (but gain simplicity). In order to ef-\\nficiently overlap data transfer and execution, its important to be able to kick off anN+1memcpy_async\\nrequest while waiting on and operating on requestN.

The element type is inferred from TyElem and\\nhas the size sizeof(TyElem). If cuda::aligned_size_t<N> type is used as the layout, the number\\nof elements specified times sizeof(TyElem)must be a multiple of N and it is recommended to use\\nstd::byte or char as the element type.\\n\\nIf specified shape or layout of the copy is of type cuda::aligned_size_t<N>, alignment will be guar-\\nanteed to be at least min(16, N).

Grid Synchronization\\n\\nPrior to the introduction of Cooperative Groups, the CUDA programming model only allowed synchro-\\nnization between thread blocks at a kernel completion boundary. The kernel boundary carries with it\\nan implicit invalidation of state, and with it, potential performance implications.\\n\\nFor example, in certain use cases, applications have a large number of small kernels, with each kernel\\nrepresenting a stage in a processing pipeline. The presence of these kernels is required by the current\\nCUDA programming model to ensure that the thread blocks operating on one pipeline stage have\\nproduced data before the thread block operating on the next pipeline stage is ready to consume it. In\\nsuch cases, the ability to provide global inter thread block synchronization would allow the application\\nto be restructured to have persistent thread blocks, which are able to synchronize on the device when\\na given stage is complete.\\n\\nTo synchronize across the grid, from within a kernel, you would simply use the grid.sync() function:\\n\\ngrid_group grid = this_grid();\\ngrid.sync();\\n\\nAnd when launching the kernel it is necessary to use, instead of the <<<...>>> execution configu-\\nration syntax, the cudaLaunchCooperativeKernel CUDA runtime launch API or the CUDA driver\\nequivalent.\\n\\nExample:\\n\\nTo guarantee co-residency of the thread blocks on the GPU, the number of blocks launched needs to\\nbe carefully considered. For example, as many blocks as there are SMs can be launched as follows:\\n\\nint dev = 0;\\ncudaDeviceProp deviceProp;\\ncudaGetDeviceProperties(&deviceProp, dev);\\n\\n(continues on next page)\\n\\n288 Chapter 11.

Introduction\\n\\n12.1.1. Overview\\n\\nDynamic Parallelism is an extension to the CUDA programming model enabling a CUDA kernel to cre-\\nate and synchronize with new work directly on the GPU. The creation of parallelism dynamically at\\nwhichever point in a program that it is needed offers exciting capabilities.\\n\\nThe ability to create work directly from the GPU can reduce the need to transfer execution control\\nand data between host and device, as launch configuration decisions can now be made at runtime by\\nthreads executing on the device. Additionally, data-dependent parallel work can be generated inline\\nwithin a kernel at run-time, taking advantage of the GPU’s hardware schedulers and load balancers\\ndynamically and adapting in response to data-driven decisions or workloads. Algorithms and pro-\\ngramming patterns that had previously required modifications to eliminate recursion, irregular loop\\nstructure, or other constructs that do not fit a flat, single-level of parallelism may more transparently\\nbe expressed.\\n\\nThis document describes the extended capabilities of CUDAwhich enable Dynamic Parallelism, includ-\\ning the modifications and additions to the CUDA programming model necessary to take advantage of\\nthese, as well as guidelines and best practices for exploiting this added capacity.\\n\\nDynamic Parallelism is only supported by devices of compute capability 3.5 and higher.\\n\\n12.1.2. Glossary\\n\\nDefinitions for terms used in this guide.\\n\\nGrid\\nA Grid is a collection of Threads. Threads in a Grid execute a Kernel Function and are divided into\\nThread Blocks.\\n\\nThread Block\\nA Thread Block is a group of threads which execute on the same multiprocessor (SM). Threads\\nwithin a Thread Block have access to shared memory and can be explicitly synchronized.\\n\\nKernel Function\\nA Kernel Function is an implicitly parallel subroutine that executes under the CUDA execution and\\nmemory model for every Thread in a Grid.\\n\\n293\\n\\n\\n\\nCUDA C++ Programming Guide, Release 12.4\\n\\nHost\\nThe Host refers to the execution environment that initially invoked CUDA. Typically the thread\\nrunning on a system’s CPU processor.\\n\\nParent\\nA Parent Thread, Thread Block, or Grid is one that has launched new grid(s), the Child Grid(s). The\\nParent is not considered completed until all of its launched Child Grids have also completed.\\n\\nChild\\nA Child thread, block, or grid is one that has been launched by a Parent grid. A Child grid must\\ncomplete before the Parent Thread, Thread Block, or Grid are considered complete.\\n\\nThread Block Scope\\nObjects with Thread Block Scope have the lifetime of a single Thread Block. They only have de-\\nfined behavior when operated on by Threads in the Thread Block that created the object and are\\ndestroyed when the Thread Block that created them is complete.\\n\\nDevice Runtime\\nThe Device Runtime refers to the runtime system and APIs available to enable Kernel Functions\\nto use Dynamic Parallelism.\\n\\n12.2. Execution Environment and Memory\\nModel\\n\\n12.2.1. Execution Environment\\n\\nThe CUDA execution model is based on primitives of threads, thread blocks, and grids, with kernel\\nfunctions defining the program executed by individual threads within a thread block and grid. When a\\nkernel function is invoked the grid’s properties are described by an execution configuration, which has\\na special syntax in CUDA. Support for dynamic parallelism in CUDA extends the ability to configure,\\nlaunch, and implicitly synchronize upon new grids to threads that are running on the device.\\n\\n12.2.1.1 Parent and Child Grids\\n\\nA device thread that configures and launches a new grid belongs to the parent grid, and the grid\\ncreated by the invocation is a child grid.\\n\\nThe invocation and completion of child grids is properly nested, meaning that the parent grid is not\\nconsidered complete until all child grids created by its threads have completed, and the runtime guar-\\nantees an implicit synchronization between the parent and child.\\n\\n294 Chapter 12. CUDA Dynamic Parallelism\\n\\n\\n\\nCUDA C++ Programming Guide, Release 12.4\\n\\nFigure 26: Parent-Child Launch Nesting\\n\\n12.2.1.2 Scope of CUDA Primitives\\n\\nOn both host and device, the CUDA runtime offers an API for launching kernels and for tracking depen-\\ndencies between launches via streams and events. On the host system, the state of launches and the\\nCUDA primitives referencing streams and events are shared by all threads within a process; however\\nprocesses execute independently and may not share CUDA objects.\\n\\nOn the device, launched kernels and CUDA objects are visible to all threads in a grid. This means, for\\nexample, that a stream may be created by one thread and used by any other thread in the grid.\\n\\n12.2.1.3 Synchronization\\n\\nWarning: Explicit synchronization with child kernels from a parent block (i.e. using cud-\\naDeviceSynchronize() in device code) is deprecated in CUDA 11.6 and removed for com-\\npute_90+ compilation. For compute capability < 9.0, compile-time opt-in by specifying\\n-DCUDA_FORCE_CDP1_IF_SUPPORTED is required to continue using cudaDeviceSynchronize()\\nin device code. Note that this is slated for full removal in a future CUDA release.\\n\\nCUDA runtime operations from any thread, including kernel launches, are visible across all the threads\\nin a grid. Thismeans that an invoking thread in the parent gridmay perform synchronization to control\\nthe launch order of grids launched by any thread in the grid on streams created by any thread in the\\ngrid. Execution of a grid is not considered complete until all launches by all threads in the grid have\\ncompleted. If all threads in a grid exit before all child launches have completed, an implicit synchro-\\nnization operation will automatically be triggered.\\n\\n12.2. Execution Environment and Memory Model 295\\n\\n\\n\\nCUDA C++ Programming Guide, Release 12.4\\n\\n12.2.1.4 Streams and Events\\n\\nCUDA Streams and Events allow control over dependencies between grid launches: grids launched into\\nthe same stream execute in-order, and events may be used to create dependencies between streams.\\nStreams and events created on the device serve this exact same purpose.\\n\\nStreams and events created within a grid exist within grid scope, but have undefined behavior when\\nused outside of the grid where they were created. As described above, all work launched by a grid\\nis implicitly synchronized when the grid exits; work launched into streams is included in this, with all\\ndependencies resolved appropriately. The behavior of operations on a stream that has been modified\\noutside of grid scope is undefined.\\n\\nStreams and events created on the host have undefined behavior when used within any kernel, just as\\nstreams and events created by a parent grid have undefined behavior if used within a child grid.\\n\\n12.2.1.5 Ordering and Concurrency\\n\\nThe ordering of kernel launches from the device runtime follows CUDA Stream ordering semantics.\\nWithin a grid, all kernel launches into the same stream (with the exception of the fire-and-forget\\nstream discussed later) are executed in-order. With multiple threads in the same grid launching into\\nthe same stream, the ordering within the stream is dependent on the thread scheduling within the\\ngrid, which may be controlled with synchronization primitives such as __syncthreads().\\n\\nNote that while named streams are shared by all threads within a grid, the implicit NULL stream is only\\nshared by all threads within a thread block. If multiple threads in a thread block launch into the implicit\\nstream, then these launches will be executed in-order. If multiple threads in different thread blocks\\nlaunch into the implicit stream, then these launches may be executed concurrently. If concurrency is\\ndesired for launches bymultiple threads within a thread block, explicit named streams should be used.\\n\\nDynamic Parallelism enables concurrency to be expressed more easily within a program; however, the\\ndevice runtime introduces no new concurrency guarantees within the CUDA execution model. There\\nis no guarantee of concurrent execution between any number of different thread blocks on a device.\\n\\nThe lack of concurrency guarantee extends to a parent grid and their child grids. When a parent grid\\nlaunches a child grid, the child may start to execute once stream dependencies are satisfied and hard-\\nware resources are available to host the child, but is not guaranteed to begin execution until the parent\\ngrid reaches an implicit synchronization point.\\n\\nWhile concurrency will often easily be achieved, it may vary as a function of device configuration, ap-\\nplication workload, and runtime scheduling. It is therefore unsafe to depend upon any concurrency\\nbetween different thread blocks.\\n\\n12.2.1.6 Device Management\\n\\nThere is nomulti-GPU support from the device runtime; the device runtime is only capable of operating\\non the device upon which it is currently executing. It is permitted, however, to query properties for any\\nCUDA capable device in the system.\\n\\n296 Chapter 12. CUDA Dynamic Parallelism\\n\\n\\n\\nCUDA C++ Programming Guide, Release 12.4\\n\\n12.2.2. Memory Model\\n\\nParent and child grids share the same global and constantmemory storage, but have distinct local and\\nshared memory.\\n\\n12.2.2.1 Coherence and Consistency\\n\\n12.2.2.1.1 Global Memory\\n\\nParent and child grids have coherent access to global memory, with weak consistency guarantees\\nbetween child and parent. There is only one point of time in the execution of a child grid when its view\\nof memory is fully consistent with the parent thread: at the point when the child grid is invoked by the\\nparent.\\n\\nAll global memory operations in the parent thread prior to the child grid’s invocation are visible to the\\nchild grid. With the removal of cudaDeviceSynchronize(), it is no longer possible to access the\\nmodifications made by the threads in the child grid from the parent grid. The only way to access the\\nmodificationsmade by the threads in the child grid before the parent grid exits is via a kernel launched\\ninto the cudaStreamTailLaunch stream.\\n\\nIn the following example, the child grid executing child_launch is only guaranteed to see the modi-\\nfications to datamade before the child grid was launched. Since thread 0 of the parent is performing\\nthe launch, the child will be consistent with the memory seen by thread 0 of the parent. Due to the\\nfirst __syncthreads() call, the child will see data[0]=0, data[1]=1, …, data[255]=255 (without\\nthe __syncthreads() call, only data[0]=0 would be guaranteed to be seen by the child). The child\\ngrid is only guaranteed to return at an implicit synchronization. This means that the modifications\\nmade by the threads in the child grid are never guaranteed to become available to the parent grid.\\nTo access modifications made by child_launch, a tail_launch kernel is launched into the cudaS-\\ntreamTailLaunch stream.\\n\\n__global__ void tail_launch(int *data) {\\ndata[threadIdx.x] = data[threadIdx.x]+1;\\n\\n}\\n\\n__global__ void child_launch(int *data) {\\ndata[threadIdx.x] = data[threadIdx.x]+1;\\n\\n}\\n\\n__global__ void parent_launch(int *data) {\\ndata[threadIdx.x] = threadIdx.x;\\n\\n__syncthreads();\\n\\nif (threadIdx.x == 0) {\\nchild_launch<<< 1, 256 >>>(data);\\ntail_launch<<< 1, 256, 0, cudaStreamTailLaunch >>>(data);\\n\\n}\\n}\\n\\nvoid host_launch(int *data) {\\nparent_launch<<< 1, 256 >>>(data);\\n\\n}\\n\\n12.2. Execution Environment and Memory Model 297\\n\\n\\n\\nCUDA C++ Programming Guide, Release 12.4\\n\\n12.2.2.1.2 Zero Copy Memory\\n\\nZero-copy systemmemory has identical coherence and consistency guarantees to global memory, and\\nfollows the semantics detailed above. A kernel may not allocate or free zero-copy memory, but may\\nuse pointers to zero-copy passed in from the host program.\\n\\n12.2.2.1.3 Constant Memory\\n\\nConstants are immutable and may not be modified from the device, even between parent and child\\nlaunches. That is to say, the value of all __constant__ variables must be set from the host prior to\\nlaunch. Constant memory is inherited automatically by all child kernels from their respective parents.\\n\\nTaking the address of a constant memory object from within a kernel thread has the same semantics\\nas for all CUDA programs, and passing that pointer from parent to child or from a child to parent is\\nnaturally supported.\\n\\n12.2.2.1.4 Shared and Local Memory\\n\\nShared and Local memory is private to a thread block or thread, respectively, and is not visible or\\ncoherent between parent and child. Behavior is undefined when an object in one of these locations is\\nreferenced outside of the scope within which it belongs, and may cause an error.\\n\\nThe NVIDIA compiler will attempt to warn if it can detect that a pointer to local or shared memory\\nis being passed as an argument to a kernel launch. At runtime, the programmer may use the __is-\\nGlobal() intrinsic to determine whether a pointer references global memory and so may safely be\\npassed to a child launch.\\n\\nNote that calls to cudaMemcpy*Async() or cudaMemset*Async() may invoke new child kernels on\\nthe device in order to preserve stream semantics. As such, passing shared or local memory pointers\\nto these APIs is illegal and will return an error.\\n\\n12.2.2.1.5 Local Memory\\n\\nLocal memory is private storage for an executing thread, and is not visible outside of that thread. It\\nis illegal to pass a pointer to local memory as a launch argument when launching a child kernel. The\\nresult of dereferencing such a local memory pointer from a child will be undefined.\\n\\nFor example the following is illegal, with undefined behavior if x_array is accessed by child_launch:\\n\\nint x_array[10]; ∕∕ Creates x_array in parent\\'s local memory\\nchild_launch<<< 1, 1 >>>(x_array);\\n\\nIt is sometimes difficult for a programmer to be aware of when a variable is placed into local memory by\\nthe compiler. As a general rule, all storage passed to a child kernel should be allocated explicitly from\\nthe global-memory heap, either with cudaMalloc(), new() or by declaring __device__ storage at\\nglobal scope. For example:\\n\\n∕∕ Correct - \"value\" is global storage\\n__device__ int value;\\n__device__ void x() {\\n\\nvalue = 5;\\nchild<<< 1, 1 >>>(&value);\\n\\n}\\n\\n298 Chapter 12. CUDA Dynamic Parallelism\\n\\n\\n\\nCUDA C++ Programming Guide, Release 12.4\\n\\n∕∕ Invalid - \"value\" is local storage\\n__device__ void y() {\\n\\nint value = 5;\\nchild<<< 1, 1 >>>(&value);\\n\\n}\\n\\n12.2.2.1.6 Texture Memory\\n\\nWrites to the global memory region over which a texture is mapped are incoherent with respect to\\ntexture accesses. Coherence for texturememory is enforced at the invocation of a child grid andwhen\\na child grid completes. This means that writes to memory prior to a child kernel launch are reflected\\nin texture memory accesses of the child. Similarly to Global Memory above, writes to memory by a\\nchild are never guaranteed to be reflected in the texture memory accesses by a parent. The only way\\nto access the modifications made by the threads in the child grid before the parent grid exits is via a\\nkernel launched into the cudaStreamTailLaunch stream. Concurrent accesses by parent and child\\nmay result in inconsistent data.\\n\\n12.3. Programming Interface\\n\\n12.3.1. CUDA C++ Reference\\n\\nThis section describes changes and additions to the CUDA C++ language extensions for supporting\\nDynamic Parallelism.\\n\\nThe language interface and API available to CUDA kernels using CUDA C++ for Dynamic Parallelism,\\nreferred to as the Device Runtime, is substantially like that of the CUDA Runtime API available on the\\nhost. Where possible the syntax and semantics of the CUDA Runtime API have been retained in order\\nto facilitate ease of code reuse for routines that may run in either the host or device environments.\\n\\nAs with all code in CUDA C++, the APIs and code outlined here is per-thread code. This enables each\\nthread to make unique, dynamic decisions regarding what kernel or operation to execute next. There\\nare no synchronization requirements between threads within a block to execute any of the provided\\ndevice runtimeAPIs, which enables the device runtimeAPI functions to be called in arbitrarily divergent\\nkernel code without deadlock.\\n\\n12.3.1.1 Device-Side Kernel Launch\\n\\nKernels may be launched from the device using the standard CUDA <<< >>> syntax:\\n\\nkernel_name<<< Dg, Db, Ns, S >>>([kernel arguments]);\\n\\n▶ Dg is of type dim3 and specifies the dimensions and size of the grid\\n\\n▶ Db is of type dim3 and specifies the dimensions and size of each thread block\\n\\n▶ Ns is of type size_t and specifies the number of bytes of shared memory that is dynamically\\nallocated per thread block for this call in addition to statically allocatedmemory. Ns is an optional\\nargument that defaults to 0.\\n\\n12.3. Programming Interface 299\\n\\n\\n\\nCUDA C++ Programming Guide, Release 12.4\\n\\n▶ S is of type cudaStream_t and specifies the stream associated with this call. The stream must\\nhave been allocated in the same grid where the call is beingmade. S is an optional argument that\\ndefaults to the NULL stream.\\n\\n12.3.1.1.1 Launches are Asynchronous\\n\\nIdentical to host-side launches, all device-side kernel launches are asynchronous with respect to the\\nlaunching thread. That is to say, the <<<>>> launch command will return immediately and the launch-\\ning thread will continue to execute until it hits an implicit launch-synchronization point (such as at a\\nkernel launched into the cudaStreamTailLaunch stream).\\n\\nThe child grid launch is posted to the device and will execute independently of the parent thread. The\\nchild grid may begin execution at any time after launch, but is not guaranteed to begin execution until\\nthe launching thread reaches an implicit launch-synchronization point.\\n\\n12.3.1.1.2 Launch Environment Configuration\\n\\nAll global device configuration settings (for example, shared memory and L1 cache size as returned\\nfromcudaDeviceGetCacheConfig(), and device limits returned fromcudaDeviceGetLimit()) will\\nbe inherited from the parent. Likewise, device limits such as stack size will remain as-configured.\\n\\nFor host-launched kernels, per-kernel configurations set from the host will take precedence over the\\nglobal setting. These configurations will be used when the kernel is launched from the device as well.\\nIt is not possible to reconfigure a kernel’s environment from the device.\\n\\n12.3.1.2 Streams\\n\\nBoth named and unnamed (NULL) streams are available from the device runtime. Named streams\\nmay be used by any thread within a grid, but stream handles may not be passed to other child/parent\\nkernels. In other words, a stream should be treated as private to the grid in which it is created.\\n\\nSimilar to host-side launch, work launched into separate streams may run concurrently, but actual\\nconcurrency is not guaranteed. Programs that depend upon concurrency between child kernels are\\nnot supported by the CUDA programming model and will have undefined behavior.\\n\\nThe host-side NULL stream’s cross-stream barrier semantic is not supported on the device (see below\\nfor details). In order to retain semantic compatibility with the host runtime, all device streams must\\nbe created using the cudaStreamCreateWithFlags() API, passing the cudaStreamNonBlocking\\nflag. The cudaStreamCreate() call is a host-runtime- only API and will fail to compile for the device.\\n\\nAs cudaStreamSynchronize() and cudaStreamQuery() are unsupported by the device runtime, a\\nkernel launched into the cudaStreamTailLaunch stream should be used instead when the applica-\\ntion needs to know that stream-launched child kernels have completed.\\n\\n300 Chapter 12. CUDA Dynamic Parallelism\\n\\n\\n\\nCUDA C++ Programming Guide, Release 12.4\\n\\n12.3.1.2.1 The Implicit (NULL) Stream\\n\\nWithin a host program, the unnamed (NULL) stream has additional barrier synchronization semantics\\nwith other streams (see Default Stream for details). The device runtime offers a single implicit, un-\\nnamed stream shared between all threads in a thread block, but as all named streamsmust be created\\nwith the cudaStreamNonBlockingflag, work launched into theNULL streamwill not insert an implicit\\ndependency on pending work in any other streams (including NULL streams of other thread blocks).\\n\\n12.3.1.2.2 The Fire-and-Forget Stream\\n\\nThe fire-and-forget named stream (cudaStreamFireAndForget) allows the user to launch fire-and-\\nforget work with less boilerplate and without stream tracking overhead. It is functionally identical to,\\nbut faster than, creating a new stream per launch, and launching into that stream.\\n\\nFire-and-forget launches are immediately scheduled for launch without any dependency on the com-\\npletion of previously launched grids. No other grid launches can depend on the completion of a fire-\\nand-forget launch, except through the implicit synchronization at the end of the parent grid. So a tail\\nlaunch or the next grid in parent grid’s streamwon’t launch before a parent grid’s fire-and-forget work\\nhas completed.\\n\\n∕∕ In this example, C2\\'s launch will not wait for C1\\'s completion\\n__global__ void P( ... ) {\\n\\nC1<<< ... , cudaStreamFireAndForget >>>( ... );\\nC2<<< ... , cudaStreamFireAndForget >>>( ... );\\n\\n}\\n\\nThe fire-and-forget stream cannot be used to record or wait on events. Attempting to do so re-\\nsults in cudaErrorInvalidValue. The fire-and-forget stream is not supported when compiled with\\nCUDA_FORCE_CDP1_IF_SUPPORTED defined. Fire-and-forget stream usage requires compilation to be\\nin 64-bit mode.\\n\\n12.3.1.2.3 The Tail Launch Stream\\n\\nThe tail launch named stream (cudaStreamTailLaunch) allows a grid to schedule a new grid for\\nlaunch after its completion. It should be possible to to use a tail launch to achieve the same func-\\ntionality as a cudaDeviceSynchronize() in most cases.\\n\\nEach grid has its own tail launch stream. All non-tail launch work launched by a grid is implicitly syn-\\nchronized before the tail stream is kicked off. I.e. A parent grid’s tail launch does not launch until the\\nparent grid and all work launched by the parent grid to ordinary streams or per-thread or fire-and-\\nforget streams have completed. If two grids are launched to the same grid’s tail launch stream, the\\nlater grid does not launch until the earlier grid and all its descendent work has completed.\\n\\n∕∕ In this example, C2 will only launch after C1 completes.\\n__global__ void P( ... ) {\\n\\nC1<<< ... , cudaStreamTailLaunch >>>( ... );\\nC2<<< ... , cudaStreamTailLaunch >>>( ... );\\n\\n}\\n\\nGrids launched into the tail launch streamwill not launch until the completion of all work by the parent\\ngrid, including all other grids (and their descendants) launched by the parent in all non-tail launched\\nstreams, including work executed or launched after the tail launch.\\n\\n12.3. Programming Interface 301\\n\\nindex.html#default-stream\\n\\n\\nCUDA C++ Programming Guide, Release 12.4\\n\\n∕∕ In this example, C will only launch after all X, F and P complete.\\n__global__ void P( ... ) {\\n\\nC<<< ... , cudaStreamTailLaunch >>>( ... );\\nX<<< ... , cudaStreamPerThread >>>( ... );\\nF<<< ... , cudaStreamFireAndForget >>>( ... )\\n\\n}\\n\\nThe next grid in the parent grid’s stream will not be launched before a parent grid’s tail launch work\\nhas completed. In other words, the tail launch stream behaves as if it were inserted between its parent\\ngrid and the next grid in its parent grid’s stream.\\n\\n∕∕ In this example, P2 will only launch after C completes.\\n__global__ void P1( ... ) {\\n\\nC<<< ... , cudaStreamTailLaunch >>>( ... );\\n}\\n\\n__global__ void P2( ... ) {\\n}\\n\\nint main ( ... ) {\\n...\\nP1<<< ... >>>( ... );\\nP2<<< ... >>>( ... );\\n...\\n\\n}\\n\\nEach grid only gets one tail launch stream. To tail launch concurrent grids, it can be done like the\\nexample below.\\n\\n∕∕ In this example, C1 and C2 will launch concurrently after P\\'s completion\\n__global__ void T( ... ) {\\n\\nC1<<< ... , cudaStreamFireAndForget >>>( ... );\\nC2<<< ... , cudaStreamFireAndForget >>>( ... );\\n\\n}\\n\\n__global__ void P( ... ) {\\n...\\nT<<< ... , cudaStreamTailLaunch >>>( ... );\\n\\n}\\n\\nThe tail launch stream cannot be used to record or wait on events. Attempting to do so re-\\nsults in cudaErrorInvalidValue. The tail launch stream is not supported when compiled with\\nCUDA_FORCE_CDP1_IF_SUPPORTED defined. Tail launch stream usage requires compilation to be in\\n64-bit mode.\\n\\n12.3.1.3 Events\\n\\nOnly the inter-stream synchronization capabilities of CUDA events are supported. Thismeans that cu-\\ndaStreamWaitEvent() is supported, but cudaEventSynchronize(), cudaEventElapsedTime(),\\nand cudaEventQuery() are not. As cudaEventElapsedTime() is not supported, cudaEvents must\\nbe created via cudaEventCreateWithFlags(), passing the cudaEventDisableTiming flag.\\n\\nAs with named streams, event objects may be shared between all threads within the grid which cre-\\nated them but are local to that grid and may not be passed to other kernels. Event handles are not\\nguaranteed to be unique between grids, so using an event handle within a grid that did not create it\\nwill result in undefined behavior.\\n\\n302 Chapter 12. CUDA Dynamic Parallelism\\n\\n\\n\\nCUDA C++ Programming Guide, Release 12.4\\n\\n12.3.1.4 Synchronization\\n\\nIt is up to the program to perform sufficient inter-thread synchronization, for example via a CUDA\\nEvent, if the calling thread is intended to synchronize with child grids invoked from other threads.\\n\\nAs it is not possible to explicitly synchronize child work from a parent thread, there is no way to guar-\\nantee that changes occuring in child grids are visible to threads within the parent grid.\\n\\n12.3.1.5 Device Management\\n\\nOnly the device on which a kernel is running will be controllable from that kernel. This means that\\ndevice APIs such as cudaSetDevice() are not supported by the device runtime. The active device\\nas seen from the GPU (returned from cudaGetDevice()) will have the same device number as seen\\nfrom the host system. The cudaDeviceGetAttribute() call may request information about another\\ndevice as this API allows specification of a device ID as a parameter of the call. Note that the catch-all\\ncudaGetDeviceProperties() API is not offered by the device runtime - properties must be queried\\nindividually.\\n\\n12.3.1.6 Memory Declarations\\n\\n12.3.1.6.1 Device and Constant Memory\\n\\nMemory declared at file scope with __device__ or __constant__memory space specifiers behaves\\nidentically when using the device runtime. All kernels may read or write device variables, whether the\\nkernel was initially launched by the host or device runtime. Equivalently, all kernels will have the same\\nview of __constant__s as declared at the module scope.\\n\\n12.3.1.6.2 Textures and Surfaces\\n\\nCUDA supports dynamically created texture and surface objects19, where a texture reference may be\\ncreated on the host, passed to a kernel, used by that kernel, and then destroyed from the host. The\\ndevice runtime does not allow creation or destruction of texture or surface objects from within device\\ncode, but texture and surface objects created from the host may be used and passed around freely on\\nthe device. Regardless of where they are created, dynamically created texture objects are always valid\\nand may be passed to child kernels from a parent.\\n\\nNote: The device runtime does not support legacy module-scope (i.e., Fermi-style) textures and sur-\\nfaces within a kernel launched from the device. Module-scope (legacy) textures may be created from\\nthe host and used in device code as for any kernel, but may only be used by a top-level kernel (i.e., the\\none which is launched from the host).\\n\\n19 Dynamically created texture and surface objects are an addition to the CUDA memory model introduced with CUDA 5.0.\\nPlease see the CUDA Programming Guide for details.\\n\\n12.3. Programming Interface 303\\n\\n\\n\\nCUDA C++ Programming Guide, Release 12.4\\n\\n12.3.1.6.3 Shared Memory Variable Declarations\\n\\nIn CUDA C++ shared memory can be declared either as a statically sized file-scope or function-scoped\\nvariable, or as an extern variable with the size determined at runtime by the kernel’s caller via a launch\\nconfiguration argument. Both types of declarations are valid under the device runtime.\\n\\n__global__ void permute(int n, int *data) {\\nextern __shared__ int smem[];\\nif (n <= 1)\\n\\nreturn;\\n\\nsmem[threadIdx.x] = data[threadIdx.x];\\n__syncthreads();\\n\\npermute_data(smem, n);\\n__syncthreads();\\n\\n∕∕ Write back to GMEM since we can\\'t pass SMEM to children.\\ndata[threadIdx.x] = smem[threadIdx.x];\\n__syncthreads();\\n\\nif (threadIdx.x == 0) {\\npermute<<< 1, 256, n∕2*sizeof(int) >>>(n∕2, data);\\npermute<<< 1, 256, n∕2*sizeof(int) >>>(n∕2, data+n∕2);\\n\\n}\\n}\\n\\nvoid host_launch(int *data) {\\npermute<<< 1, 256, 256*sizeof(int) >>>(256, data);\\n\\n}\\n\\n12.3.1.6.4 Symbol Addresses\\n\\nDevice-side symbols (i.e., those marked __device__) may be referenced from within a kernel simply\\nvia the & operator, as all global-scope device variables are in the kernel’s visible address space. This\\nalso applies to __constant__ symbols, although in this case the pointer will reference read-only data.\\n\\nGiven that device-side symbols can be referenced directly, those CUDA runtime APIs which reference\\nsymbols (e.g., cudaMemcpyToSymbol() or cudaGetSymbolAddress()) are redundant and hence not\\nsupported by the device runtime. Note this implies that constant data cannot be altered from within\\na running kernel, even ahead of a child kernel launch, as references to __constant__ space are read-\\nonly.\\n\\n12.3.1.7 API Errors and Launch Failures\\n\\nAs usual for the CUDA runtime, any function may return an error code. The last error code returned\\nis recorded and may be retrieved via the cudaGetLastError() call. Errors are recorded per-thread,\\nso that each thread can identify the most recent error that it has generated. The error code is of type\\ncudaError_t.\\n\\nSimilar to a host-side launch, device-side launches may fail for many reasons (invalid arguments, etc).\\nThe user must call cudaGetLastError() to determine if a launch generated an error, however lack\\nof an error after launch does not imply the child kernel completed successfully.\\n\\n304 Chapter 12. CUDA Dynamic Parallelism\\n\\n\\n\\nCUDA C++ Programming Guide, Release 12.4\\n\\nFor device-side exceptions, e.g., access to an invalid address, an error in a child grid will be returned to\\nthe host.\\n\\n12.3.1.7.1 Launch Setup APIs\\n\\nKernel launch is a system-level mechanism exposed through the device runtime library, and as such\\nis available directly from PTX via the underlying cudaGetParameterBuffer() and cudaLaunchDe-\\nvice() APIs. It is permitted for a CUDA application to call these APIs itself, with the same require-\\nments as for PTX. In both cases, the user is then responsible for correctly populating all necessary data\\nstructures in the correct format according to specification. Backwards compatibility is guaranteed in\\nthese data structures.\\n\\nAs with host-side launch, the device-side operator <<<>>>maps to underlying kernel launch APIs. This\\nis so that users targeting PTX will be able to enact a launch, and so that the compiler front-end can\\ntranslate <<<>>> into these calls.\\n\\nTable 9: New Device-only Launch Implementation Functions\\n\\nRuntime API Launch\\nFunctions\\n\\nDescription of Difference From Host Runtime Behaviour (behavior is\\nidentical if no description)\\n\\ncudaGetParameter-\\nBuffer\\n\\nGenerated automatically from <<<>>>.

Device-side Launch from PTX\\n\\nThis section is for the programming language and compiler implementers who target Parallel Thread\\nExecution (PTX) and plan to support Dynamic Parallelism in their language. It provides the low-level\\ndetails related to supporting kernel launches at the PTX level.\\n\\n12.3.2.1 Kernel Launch APIs\\n\\nDevice-side kernel launches can be implemented using the following two APIs accessible from PTX:\\ncudaLaunchDevice() and cudaGetParameterBuffer(). cudaLaunchDevice() launches the\\nspecified kernel with the parameter buffer that is obtained by calling cudaGetParameterBuffer()\\nand filled with the parameters to the launched kernel. The parameter buffer can be NULL, i.e., no need\\nto invoke cudaGetParameterBuffer(), if the launched kernel does not take any parameters.\\n\\n12.3.2.1.1 cudaLaunchDevice\\n\\nAt the PTX level, cudaLaunchDevice()needs to be declared in one of the two forms shown below\\nbefore it is used.\\n\\n∕∕ PTX-level Declaration of cudaLaunchDevice() when .address_size is 64\\n.extern .func(.param .b32 func_retval0) cudaLaunchDevice\\n(\\n\\n.param .b64 func,\\n\\n.param .b64 parameterBuffer,\\n\\n.param .align 4 .b8 gridDimension[12],\\n\\n.param .align 4 .b8 blockDimension[12],\\n\\n.param .b32 sharedMemSize,\\n\\n.param .b64 stream\\n)\\n;\\n\\nThe CUDA-level declaration below is mapped to one of the aforementioned PTX-level declarations and\\nis found in the system header file cuda_device_runtime_api.h.

API level device management, kernel\\nlaunching, device memcpy, streammanagement, and event management are exposed from the device\\nruntime.\\n\\nProgramming for the device runtime should be familiar to someone who already has experience with\\nCUDA. Device runtime syntax and semantics are largely the same as that of the host API, with any\\nexceptions detailed earlier in this document.\\n\\nThe following example shows a simple Hello World program incorporating dynamic parallelism:\\n\\n#include <stdio.h>\\n\\n__global__ void childKernel()\\n{\\n\\nprintf(\"Hello \");\\n}\\n\\n__global__ void tailKernel()\\n{\\n\\nprintf(\"World!\\\\n\");\\n}\\n\\n__global__ void parentKernel()\\n{\\n\\n∕∕ launch child\\nchildKernel<<<1,1>>>();\\n\\n(continues on next page)\\n\\n310 Chapter 12.

Performance\\n\\n12.4.2.1 Dynamic-parallelism-enabled Kernel Overhead\\n\\nSystem software which is active when controlling dynamic launches may impose an overhead on any\\nkernel which is running at the time, whether or not it invokes kernel launches of its own. This over-\\nhead arises from the device runtime’s execution tracking and management software and may result\\nin decreased performance. This overhead is, in general, incurred for applications that link against the\\ndevice runtime library.\\n\\n12.4.3. Implementation Restrictions and Limitations\\n\\nDynamic Parallelism guarantees all semantics described in this document, however, certain hardware\\nand software resources are implementation-dependent and limit the scale, performance and other\\nproperties of a program which uses the device runtime.\\n\\n12.4. Programming Guidelines 311\\n\\n\\n\\nCUDA C++ Programming Guide, Release 12.4\\n\\n12.4.3.1 Runtime\\n\\n12.4.3.1.1 Memory Footprint\\n\\nThe device runtime system software reservesmemory for variousmanagement purposes, in particular\\na reservation for tracking pending grid launches. Configuration controls are available to reduce the size\\nof this reservation in exchange for certain launch limitations. See Configuration Options, below, for\\ndetails.\\n\\n12.4.3.1.2 Pending Kernel Launches\\n\\nWhen a kernel is launched, all associated configuration and parameter data is tracked until the kernel\\ncompletes. This data is stored within a system-managed launch pool.\\n\\nThe size of the fixed-size launch pool is configurable by calling cudaDeviceSetLimit() from the host\\nand specifying cudaLimitDevRuntimePendingLaunchCount.\\n\\n12.4.3.1.3 Configuration Options\\n\\nResource allocation for the device runtime system software is controlled via the cudaDevice-\\nSetLimit() API from the host program. Limits must be set before any kernel is launched, and may\\nnot be changed while the GPU is actively running programs.\\n\\nThe following named limits may be set:\\n\\n312 Chapter 12. CUDA Dynamic Parallelism\\n\\nindex.html#configuration-options\\n\\n\\nCUDA C++ Programming Guide, Release 12.4\\n\\nLimit Behavior\\n\\ncudaLimitDevRuntimePendingLaunchCount Controls the amount of memory set aside for\\nbuffering kernel launches and events which have\\nnot yet begun to execute, due either to un-\\nresolved dependencies or lack of execution re-\\nsources. When the buffer is full, an attempt\\nto allocate a launch slot during a device side\\nkernel launch will fail and return cudaError-\\nLaunchOutOfResources, while an attempt to\\nallocate an event slot will fail and return cud-\\naErrorMemoryAllocation. The default num-\\nber of launch slots is 2048. Applications may\\nincrease the number of launch and/or event\\nslots by setting cudaLimitDevRuntimePend-\\ningLaunchCount. The number of event slots al-\\nlocated is twice the value of that limit.\\n\\ncudaLimitStackSize Controls the stack size in bytes of each GPU\\nthread. The CUDA driver automatically increases\\nthe per-thread stack size for each kernel launch\\nas needed. This size isn’t reset back to the\\noriginal value after each launch. To set the\\nper-thread stack size to a different value, cud-\\naDeviceSetLimit() can be called to set this\\nlimit. The stack will be immediately resized, and\\nif necessary, the device will block until all pre-\\nceding requested tasks are complete. cudaDe-\\nviceGetLimit() can be called to get the cur-\\nrent per-thread stack size.\\n\\n12.4.3.1.4 Memory Allocation and Lifetime\\n\\ncudaMalloc() and cudaFree() have distinct semantics between the host and device environments.\\nWhen invoked from the host, cudaMalloc() allocates a new region from unused device memory.\\nWhen invoked from the device runtime these functions map to device-side malloc() and free().\\nThis implies that within the device environment the total allocatable memory is limited to the device\\nmalloc() heap size, whichmay be smaller than the available unused devicememory. Also, it is an error\\nto invoke cudaFree() from the host program on a pointer which was allocated by cudaMalloc() on\\nthe device or vice-versa.\\n\\ncudaMalloc() on Host cudaMalloc() on Device\\n\\ncudaFree() on Host Supported Not Supported\\n\\ncudaFree() on Device Not Supported Supported\\n\\nAllocation limit Free device memory cudaLimitMallocHeapSize\\n\\n12.4. Programming Guidelines 313\\n\\n\\n\\nCUDA C++ Programming Guide, Release 12.4\\n\\n12.4.3.1.5 SM Id and Warp Id\\n\\nNote that in PTX %smid and %warpid are defined as volatile values. The device runtimemay reschedule\\nthread blocks onto different SMs in order to more efficiently manage resources. As such, it is unsafe\\nto rely upon %smid or %warpid remaining unchanged across the lifetime of a thread or thread block.\\n\\n12.4.3.1.6 ECC Errors\\n\\nNo notification of ECC errors is available to code within a CUDA kernel. ECC errors are reported at the\\nhost side once the entire launch tree has completed. Any ECC errors which arise during execution of\\na nested program will either generate an exception or continue execution (depending upon error and\\nconfiguration).\\n\\n12.5. CDP2 vs CDP1\\n\\nThis section summarises the differences between, and the compatibility and interoperability of, the\\nnew (CDP2) and legacy (CDP1) CUDA Dynamic Parallelism interfaces. It also shows how to opt-out of\\nthe CDP2 interface on devices of compute capability less than 9.0.\\n\\n12.5.1. Differences Between CDP1 and CDP2\\n\\nExplicit device-side synchronization is no longer possible with CDP2 or on devices of compute capa-\\nbility 9.0 or higher. Implicit synchronization (such as tail launches) must be used instead.\\n\\nAttempting to query or set cudaLimitDevRuntimeSyncDepth (or\\nCU_LIMIT_DEV_RUNTIME_SYNC_DEPTH) with CDP2 or on devices of compute capability 9.0 or\\nhigher results in cudaErrorUnsupportedLimit.\\n\\nCDP2 no longer has a virtualized pool for pending launches that don’t fit in the fixed-sized pool. cu-\\ndaLimitDevRuntimePendingLaunchCount must be set to be large enough to avoid running out of\\nlaunch slots.\\n\\nFor CDP2, there is a limit to the total number of events existing at once (note that events are de-\\nstroyed only after a launch completes), equal to twice the pending launch count. cudaLimitDevRun-\\ntimePendingLaunchCountmust be set to be large enough to avoid running out of event slots.\\n\\nStreams are tracked per grid with CDP2 or on devices of compute capability 9.0 or higher, not per\\nthread block. This allows work to be launched into a stream created by another thread block. At-\\ntempting to do so with the CDP1 results in cudaErrorInvalidValue.\\n\\nCDP2 introduces the tail launch (cudaStreamTailLaunch) and fire-and-forget\\n(cudaStreamFireAndForget) named streams.\\n\\nCDP2 is supported only under 64-bit compilation mode.\\n\\n314 Chapter 12. CUDA Dynamic Parallelism\\n\\n\\n\\nCUDA C++ Programming Guide, Release 12.4\\n\\n12.5.2. Compatibility and Interoperability\\n\\nCDP2 is the default. Functions can be compiledwith -DCUDA_FORCE_CDP1_IF_SUPPORTED to opt-out\\nof using CDP2 on devices of compute capability less than 9.0.\\n\\nFunction compiler with CUDA\\n12.0 and newer (default)\\n\\nFunction compiled with pre-CUDA 12.0\\nor with CUDA 12.0 and newer with\\n-DCUDA_FORCE_CDP1_IF_SUPPORTED speci-\\nfied\\n\\nCompilation Compile error if device code ref-\\nerences cudaDeviceSynchro-\\nnize.\\n\\nCompile error if code references cudaStream-\\nTailLaunch or cudaStreamFireAndForget.\\nCompile error if device code references cud-\\naDeviceSynchronize and code is compiled\\nfor sm_90 or newer.\\n\\nCompute capa-\\nbility < 9.0\\n\\nNew interface is used. Legacy interface is used.\\n\\nCompute capa-\\nbility 9.0 and\\nhigher\\n\\nNew interface is used. New interface is used. If function ref-\\nerences cudaDeviceSynchronize in device\\ncode, function load returns cudaErrorSym-\\nbolNotFound (this could happen if the code\\nis compiled for devices of compute capability\\nless than 9.0, but run on devices of compute\\ncapability 9.0 or higher using JIT).\\n\\nFunctions using CDP1 and CDP2 may be loaded and run simultaneously in the same context. The\\nCDP1 functions are able to use CDP1-specific features (e.g. cudaDeviceSynchronize) and CDP2\\nfunctions are able to use CDP2-specific features (e.g. tail launch and fire-and-forget launch).\\n\\nA function using CDP1 cannot launch a function using CDP2, and vice versa. If a function that would\\nuse CDP1 contains in its call graph a function that would use CDP2, or vice versa, cudaErrorCdpVer-\\nsionMismatch would result during function load.\\n\\n12.6.

Even if the invoking\\nthreads do not explicitly synchronize on the child grids launched, the runtime guarantees an implicit\\nsynchronization between the parent and child.\\n\\nWarning: Explicit synchronization with child kernels from a parent block (i.e. using cudaDe-\\nviceSynchronize() in device code) is deprecated in CUDA 11.6, removed for compute_90+ com-\\npilation, and is slated for full removal in a future CUDA release.\\n\\n12.6.1.1.2 Scope of CUDA Primitives (CDP1)\\n\\nSee Scope of CUDA Primitives, above, for CDP2 version of document.\\n\\nOnboth host anddevice, theCUDA runtimeoffers anAPI for launching kernels, forwaiting for launched\\nwork to complete, and for tracking dependencies between launches via streams and events. On the\\nhost system, the state of launches and theCUDAprimitives referencing streams and events are shared\\nby all threads within a process; however processes execute independently and may not share CUDA\\nobjects.\\n\\nA similar hierarchy exists on the device: launched kernels and CUDA objects are visible to all threads\\nin a thread block, but are independent between thread blocks.

With multiple\\nthreads in the same thread block launching into the same stream, the ordering within the stream is\\ndependent on the thread scheduling within the block, which may be controlled with synchronization\\nprimitives such as __syncthreads().\\n\\nNote that because streams are shared by all threads within a thread block, the implicit NULL stream is\\nalso shared. If multiple threads in a thread block launch into the implicit stream, then these launches\\nwill be executed in-order. If concurrency is desired, explicit named streams should be used.\\n\\nDynamic Parallelism enables concurrency to be expressed more easily within a program; however, the\\ndevice runtime introduces no new concurrency guarantees within the CUDA execution model. There\\nis no guarantee of concurrent execution between any number of different thread blocks on a device.\\n\\nThe lack of concurrency guarantee extends to parent thread blocks and their child grids. When a\\nparent thread block launches a child grid, the child is not guaranteed to begin execution until the\\nparent thread block reaches an explicit synchronization point (such as cudaDeviceSynchronize()).\\n\\nWarning: Explicit synchronization with child kernels from a parent block (i.e. using cudaDe-\\nviceSynchronize() in device code) is deprecated in CUDA 11.6, removed for compute_90+ com-\\npilation, and is slated for full removal in a future CUDA release.\\n\\nWhile concurrency will often easily be achieved, it may vary as a function of deviceconfiguration, ap-\\nplication workload, and runtime scheduling.

There are two points in the execution of a child gridwhen its view ofmemory\\nis fully consistent with the parent thread: when the child grid is invoked by the parent, and when the\\nchild grid completes as signaled by a synchronization API invocation in the parent thread.\\n\\nWarning: Explicit synchronization with child kernels from a parent block (i.e. using cudaDe-\\nviceSynchronize() in device code) is deprecated in CUDA 11.6, removed for compute_90+ com-\\npilation, and is slated for full removal in a future CUDA release.\\n\\nAll global memory operations in the parent thread prior to the child grid’s invocation are visible to\\nthe child grid. All memory operations of the child grid are visible to the parent after the parent has\\nsynchronized on the child grid’s completion.\\n\\nIn the following example, the child grid executing child_launch is only guaranteed to see the modi-\\nfications to datamade before the child grid was launched. Since thread 0 of the parent is performing\\nthe launch, the child will be consistent with the memory seen by thread 0 of the parent. Due to the\\nfirst __syncthreads() call, the child will see data[0]=0, data[1]=1, …, data[255]=255 (without\\nthe __syncthreads() call, only data[0] would be guaranteed to be seen by the child). When the\\nchild grid returns, thread 0 is guaranteed to see modifications made by the threads in its child grid.\\nThose modifications become available to the other threads of the parent grid only after the second\\n__syncthreads() call:\\n\\n__global__ void child_launch(int *data) {\\ndata[threadIdx.x] = data[threadIdx.x]+1;\\n\\n}\\n\\n__global__ void parent_launch(int *data) {\\ndata[threadIdx.x] = threadIdx.x;\\n\\n__syncthreads();\\n\\nif (threadIdx.x == 0) {\\nchild_launch<<< 1, 256 >>>(data);\\ncudaDeviceSynchronize();\\n\\n}\\n\\n__syncthreads();\\n(continues on next page)\\n\\n12.6.

A kernel may not allocate or free zero-copy memory, but may\\nuse pointers to zero-copy passed in from the host program.\\n\\n12.6.1.2.1.3 Constant Memory (CDP1)\\n\\nSee Constant Memory, above, for CDP2 version of document.\\n\\nConstants are immutable and may not be modified from the device, even between parent and child\\nlaunches. That is to say, the value of all __constant__ variables must be set from the host prior to\\nlaunch. Constant memory is inherited automatically by all child kernels from their respective parents.\\n\\nTaking the address of a constant memory object from within a kernel thread has the same semantics\\nas for all CUDA programs, and passing that pointer from parent to child or from a child to parent is\\nnaturally supported.\\n\\n12.6.1.2.1.4 Shared and Local Memory (CDP1)\\n\\nSee Shared and Local Memory, above, for CDP2 version of document.\\n\\nShared and Local memory is private to a thread block or thread, respectively, and is not visible or\\ncoherent between parent and child. Behavior is undefined when an object in one of these locations is\\nreferenced outside of the scope within which it belongs, and may cause an error.\\n\\nThe NVIDIA compiler will attempt to warn if it can detect that a pointer to local or shared memory\\nis being passed as an argument to a kernel launch. At runtime, the programmer may use the __is-\\nGlobal() intrinsic to determine whether a pointer references global memory and so may safely be\\npassed to a child launch.\\n\\nNote that calls to cudaMemcpy*Async() or cudaMemset*Async() may invoke new child kernels on\\nthe device in order to preserve stream semantics. As such, passing shared or local memory pointers\\nto these APIs is illegal and will return an error.\\n\\n320 Chapter 12.

It\\nis illegal to pass a pointer to local memory as a launch argument when launching a child kernel. The\\nresult of dereferencing such a local memory pointer from a child will be undefined.\\n\\nFor example the following is illegal, with undefined behavior if x_array is accessed by child_launch:\\n\\nint x_array[10]; ∕∕ Creates x_array in parent\\'s local memory\\nchild_launch<<< 1, 1 >>>(x_array);\\n\\nIt is sometimes difficult for a programmer to be aware of when a variable is placed into local memory by\\nthe compiler. As a general rule, all storage passed to a child kernel should be allocated explicitly from\\nthe global-memory heap, either with cudaMalloc(), new() or by declaring __device__ storage at\\nglobal scope. For example:\\n\\n∕∕ Correct - \"value\" is global storage\\n__device__ int value;\\n__device__ void x() {\\n\\nvalue = 5;\\nchild<<< 1, 1 >>>(&value);\\n\\n}\\n\\n∕∕ Invalid - \"value\" is local storage\\n__device__ void y() {\\n\\nint value = 5;\\nchild<<< 1, 1 >>>(&value);\\n\\n}\\n\\n12.6.1.2.1.6 Texture Memory (CDP1)\\n\\nSee Texture Memory, above, for CDP2 version of document.\\n\\nWrites to the global memory region over which a texture is mapped are incoherent with respect to\\ntexture accesses. Coherence for texturememory is enforced at the invocation of a child grid andwhen\\na child grid completes. This means that writes to memory prior to a child kernel launch are reflected\\nin texture memory accesses of the child. Similarly, writes to memory by a child will be reflected in the\\ntexturememory accesses by a parent, but only after the parent synchronizes on the child’s completion.\\nConcurrent accesses by parent and child may result in inconsistent data.\\n\\nWarning: Explicit synchronization with child kernels from a parent block (i.e. using cudaDe-\\nviceSynchronize() in device code) is deprecated in CUDA 11.6, removed for compute_90+ com-\\npilation, and is slated for full removal in a future CUDA release.\\n\\n12.6.

Where possible the syntax and semantics of the CUDA Runtime API have been retained in order\\nto facilitate ease of code reuse for routines that may run in either the host or device environments.\\n\\nAs with all code in CUDA C++, the APIs and code outlined here is per-thread code. This enables each\\nthread to make unique, dynamic decisions regarding what kernel or operation to execute next. There\\nare no synchronization requirements between threads within a block to execute any of the provided\\ndevice runtimeAPIs, which enables the device runtimeAPI functions to be called in arbitrarily divergent\\nkernel code without deadlock.\\n\\n12.6.2.1.1 Device-Side Kernel Launch (CDP1)\\n\\nSee Device-Side Kernel Launch, above, for CDP2 version of document.\\n\\nKernels may be launched from the device using the standard CUDA <<< >>> syntax:\\n\\nkernel_name<<< Dg, Db, Ns, S >>>([kernel arguments]);\\n\\n▶ Dg is of type dim3 and specifies the dimensions and size of the grid\\n\\n▶ Db is of type dim3 and specifies the dimensions and size of each thread block\\n\\n▶ Ns is of type size_t and specifies the number of bytes of sharedmemory that is dynamically al-\\nlocated per thread block for this call and addition to statically allocatedmemory. Ns is an optional\\nargument that defaults to 0.\\n\\n▶ S is of type cudaStream_t and specifies the stream associated with this call. The stream must\\nhave been allocated in the same thread block where the call is being made. S is an optional\\nargument that defaults to 0.\\n\\n12.6.2.1.1.1 Launches are Asynchronous (CDP1)\\n\\nSee Launches are Asynchronous, above, for CDP2 version of document.\\n\\nIdentical to host-side launches, all device-side kernel launches are asynchronous with respect to the\\nlaunching thread.

Likewise, device limits such as stack size will remain as-configured.\\n\\nFor host-launched kernels, per-kernel configurations set from the host will take precedence over the\\nglobal setting. These configurations will be used when the kernel is launched from the device as well.\\nIt is not possible to reconfigure a kernel’s environment from the device.\\n\\n12.6.2.1.2 Streams (CDP1)\\n\\nSee Streams, above, for CDP2 version of document.\\n\\nBoth named and unnamed (NULL) streams are available from the device runtime. Named streamsmay\\nbe used by any thread within a thread-block, but stream handles may not be passed to other blocks\\nor child/parent kernels. In other words, a stream should be treated as private to the block in which it\\nis created. Stream handles are not guaranteed to be unique between blocks, so using a stream handle\\nwithin a block that did not allocate it will result in undefined behavior.\\n\\nSimilar to host-side launch, work launched into separate streams may run concurrently, but actual\\nconcurrency is not guaranteed.

The device runtime offers a single implicit, un-\\nnamed stream shared between all threads in a block, but as all named streams must be created with\\nthe cudaStreamNonBlocking flag, work launched into the NULL stream will not insert an implicit\\ndependency on pending work in any other streams (including NULL streams of other thread blocks).\\n\\n12.6.2.1.3 Events (CDP1)\\n\\nSee Events, above, for CDP2 version of document.\\n\\nOnly the inter-stream synchronization capabilities of CUDA events are supported. Thismeans that cu-\\ndaStreamWaitEvent() is supported, but cudaEventSynchronize(), cudaEventElapsedTime(),\\nand cudaEventQuery() are not. As cudaEventElapsedTime() is not supported, cudaEvents must\\nbe created via cudaEventCreateWithFlags(), passing the cudaEventDisableTiming flag.\\n\\nAs for all device runtime objects, event objects may be shared between all threads within the thread-\\nblock which created them but are local to that block and may not be passed to other kernels, or be-\\ntween blocks within the same kernel. Event handles are not guaranteed to be unique between blocks,\\nso using an event handle within a block that did not create it will result in undefined behavior.\\n\\n12.6.2.1.4 Synchronization (CDP1)\\n\\nSee Synchronization, above, for CDP2 version of document.\\n\\nWarning: Explicit synchronization with child kernels from a parent block (i.e. using cudaDe-\\nviceSynchronize() in device code) is deprecated in CUDA 11.6, removed for compute_90+ com-\\npilation, and is slated for full removal in a future CUDA release.\\n\\nThe cudaDeviceSynchronize() function will synchronize on all work launched by any thread in\\nthe thread-block up to the point where cudaDeviceSynchronize() was called. Note that cud-\\naDeviceSynchronize() may be called from within divergent code (see Block Wide Synchronization\\n(CDP1)).\\n\\nIt is up to the program to perform sufficient additional inter-thread synchronization, for example via\\na call to __syncthreads(), if the calling thread is intended to synchronize with child grids invoked\\nfrom other threads.\\n\\n12.6.2.1.4.1 Block Wide Synchronization (CDP1)\\n\\nSee CUDA Dynamic Parallelism, above, for CDP2 version of document.\\n\\nThe cudaDeviceSynchronize() function does not imply intra-block synchronization. In particular,\\nwithout explicit synchronization via a __syncthreads() directive the calling thread can make no as-\\nsumptions about what work has been launched by any thread other than itself. For example if multiple\\nthreads within a block are each launching work and synchronization is desired for all this work at once\\n(perhaps because of event-based dependencies), it is up to the program to guarantee that this work\\nis submitted by all threads before calling cudaDeviceSynchronize().\\n\\n324 Chapter 12.

This means that\\ndevice APIs such as cudaSetDevice() are not supported by the device runtime. The active device\\nas seen from the GPU (returned from cudaGetDevice()) will have the same device number as seen\\nfrom the host system. The cudaDeviceGetAttribute() call may request information about another\\ndevice as this API allows specification of a device ID as a parameter of the call.

Configuration controls are available to reduce the size\\nof these reservations in exchange for certain launch limitations. See Configuration Options (CDP1),\\nbelow, for details.\\n\\nThe majority of reserved memory is allocated as backing-store for parent kernel state, for use when\\nsynchronizing on a child launch. Conservatively, this memory must support storing of state for the\\nmaximum number of live threads possible on the device. This means that each parent generation at\\nwhich cudaDeviceSynchronize() is callablemay require up to 860MB of devicememory, depending\\non the device configuration, which will be unavailable for program use even if it is not all consumed.\\n\\n12.6.3.3.1.2 Nesting and Synchronization Depth (CDP1)\\n\\nSee CUDA Dynamic Parallelism, above, for CDP2 version of document.\\n\\nUsing the device runtime, one kernel may launch another kernel, and that kernel may launch another,\\nand so on. Each subordinate launch is considered a new nesting level, and the total number of levels is\\nthe nesting depth of the program. The synchronization depth is defined as the deepest level at which\\nthe program will explicitly synchronize on a child launch. Typically this is one less than the nesting\\ndepth of the program, but if the program does not need to call cudaDeviceSynchronize() at all\\nlevels then the synchronization depth might be substantially different to the nesting depth.\\n\\nWarning: Explicit synchronization with child kernels from a parent block (i.e. using cudaDe-\\nviceSynchronize() in device code) is deprecated in CUDA 11.6, removed for compute_90+ com-\\npilation, and is slated for full removal in a future CUDA release.\\n\\nThe overall maximum nesting depth is limited to 24, but practically speaking the real limit will be the\\namount of memory required by the system for each new level (see Memory Footprint (CDP1) above).\\nAny launch which would result in a kernel at a deeper level than the maximum will fail. Note that this\\nmay also apply to cudaMemcpyAsync(), which might itself generate a kernel launch.

Introduction\\n\\nThe Virtual MemoryManagement APIs provide a way for the application to directly manage the unified\\nvirtual address space that CUDA provides to map physical memory to virtual addresses accessible by\\nthe GPU. Introduced in CUDA 10.2, these APIs additionally provide a new way to interop with other\\nprocesses and graphics APIs like OpenGL and Vulkan, as well as provide newer memory attributes that\\na user can tune to fit their applications.\\n\\nHistorically, memory allocation calls (such as cudaMalloc()) in the CUDA programming model have\\nreturned a memory address that points to the GPUmemory. The address thus obtained could be used\\nwith any CUDA API or inside a device kernel. However, the memory allocated could not be resized de-\\npending on the user’s memory needs. In order to increase an allocation’s size, the user had to explicitly\\nallocate a larger buffer, copy data from the initial allocation, free it and then continue to keep track\\nof the newer allocation’s address. This often leads to lower performance and higher peak memory\\nutilization for applications. Essentially, users had a malloc-like interface for allocating GPU memory,\\nbut did not have a corresponding realloc to complement it. The Virtual Memory Management APIs de-\\ncouple the idea of an address and memory and allow the application to handle them separately. The\\nAPIs allow applications to map and unmap memory from a virtual address range as they see fit.\\n\\nIn the case of enabling peer device access to memory allocations by using cudaEnablePeerAccess,\\nall past and future user allocations aremapped to the target peer device. This lead to users unwittingly\\npaying runtime cost ofmapping all cudaMalloc allocations to peer devices. However, inmost situations\\napplications communicate by sharing only a few allocations with another device and not all allocations\\nare required to be mapped to all the devices. With Virtual Memory Management, applications can\\nspecifically choose certain allocations to be accessible from target devices.\\n\\nThe CUDA Virtual MemoryManagement APIs expose fine grained control to the user for managing the\\nGPU memory in applications. It provides APIs that let users:\\n\\n▶ Place memory allocated on different devices into a contiguous VA range.\\n\\n▶ Perform interprocess communication for memory sharing using platform-specific mechanisms.\\n\\n▶ Opt into newer memory types on the devices that support them.\\n\\nIn order to allocate memory, the Virtual Memory Management programming model exposes the fol-\\nlowing functionality:\\n\\n▶ Allocating physical memory.\\n\\n▶ Reserving a VA range.\\n\\n339\\n\\nhttps://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-driver-api/group__CUDA__VA.html\\n\\n\\nCUDA C++ Programming Guide, Release 12.4\\n\\n▶ Mapping allocated memory to the VA range.\\n\\n▶ Controlling access rights on the mapped range.\\n\\nNote that the suite of APIs described in this section require a system that supports UVA.\\n\\n13.2. Query for Support\\n\\nBefore attempting to use Virtual Memory Management APIs, applications must ensure that the de-\\nvices they want to use support CUDA Virtual Memory Management. The following code sample shows\\nquerying for Virtual Memory Management support:\\n\\nint deviceSupportsVmm;\\nCUresult result = cuDeviceGetAttribute(&deviceSupportsVmm, CU_DEVICE_ATTRIBUTE_\\n↪→VIRTUAL_MEMORY_MANAGEMENT_SUPPORTED, device);\\nif (deviceSupportsVmm != 0) {\\n\\n∕∕ `device` supports Virtual Memory Management\\n}\\n\\n13.3. Allocating Physical Memory\\n\\nThe first step in memory allocation using Virtual Memory Management APIs is to create a physical\\nmemory chunk that will provide a backing for the allocation. In order to allocate physical memory,\\napplications must use the cuMemCreate API. The allocation created by this function does not have\\nany device or host mappings. The function argument CUmemGenericAllocationHandle describes\\nthe properties of the memory to allocate such as the location of the allocation, if the allocation is\\ngoing to be shared to another process (or other Graphics APIs), or the physical attributes of the mem-\\nory to be allocated. Users must ensure the requested allocation’s size must be aligned to appropri-\\nate granularity. Information regarding an allocation’s granularity requirements can be queried using\\ncuMemGetAllocationGranularity. The following code snippet shows allocating physical memory\\nwith cuMemCreate:\\n\\nCUmemGenericAllocationHandle allocatePhysicalMemory(int device, size_t size) {\\nCUmemAllocationProp prop = {};\\nprop.type = CU_MEM_ALLOCATION_TYPE_PINNED;\\nprop.location.type = CU_MEM_LOCATION_TYPE_DEVICE;\\nprop.location.id = device;\\ncuMemGetAllocationGranularity(&granularity, &prop, CU_MEM_ALLOC_GRANULARITY_\\n\\n↪→MINIMUM);\\n\\n∕∕ Ensure size matches granularity requirements for the allocation\\nsize_t padded_size = ROUND_UP(size, granularity);\\n\\n∕∕ Allocate physical memory\\nCUmemGenericAllocationHandle allocHandle;\\ncuMemCreate(&allocHandle, padded_size, &prop, 0);\\n\\nreturn allocHandle;\\n}\\n\\n340 Chapter 13. Virtual Memory Management\\n\\n\\n\\nCUDA C++ Programming Guide, Release 12.4\\n\\nThe memory allocated by cuMemCreate is referenced by the CUmemGenericAllocationHandle it\\nreturns. This is a departure from the cudaMalloc-style of allocation, which returns a pointer to the\\nGPU memory, which was directly accessible by CUDA kernel executing on the device. The memory\\nallocated cannot be used for any operations other than querying properties using cuMemGetAlloca-\\ntionPropertiesFromHandle. In order to make this memory accessible, applications must map this\\nmemory into a VA range reserved by cuMemAddressReserve and provide suitable access rights to it.\\nApplications must free the allocated memory using the cuMemRelease API.\\n\\n13.3.1. Shareable Memory Allocations\\n\\nWith cuMemCreate users now have the facility to indicate to CUDA, at allocation time, that they\\nhave earmarked a particular allocation for Inter process communication and graphics interop pur-\\nposes. Applications can do this by setting CUmemAllocationProp::requestedHandleTypes to\\na platform-specific field. On Windows, when CUmemAllocationProp::requestedHandleTypes\\nis set to CU_MEM_HANDLE_TYPE_WIN32 applications must also specify an LPSECURITYATTRIBUTES\\nattribute in CUmemAllocationProp::win32HandleMetaData. This security attribute defines the\\nscope of which exported allocations may be transferred to other processes.\\n\\nThe CUDAVirtual MemoryManagement API functions do not support the legacy interprocess commu-\\nnication functions with their memory. Instead, they expose a new mechanism for interprocess com-\\nmunication that uses OS-specific handles. Applications can obtain these OS-specific handles corre-\\nsponding to the allocations by using cuMemExportToShareableHandle. The handles thus obtained\\ncan be transferred by using the usual OS native mechanisms for inter process communication. The\\nrecipient process should import the allocation by using cuMemImportFromShareableHandle.\\n\\nUsers must ensure they query for support of the requested handle type before attempting to export\\nmemory allocated with cuMemCreate. The following code snippet illustrates query for handle type\\nsupport in a platform-specific way.\\n\\nint deviceSupportsIpcHandle;\\n#if defined(__linux__)\\n\\ncuDeviceGetAttribute(&deviceSupportsIpcHandle, CU_DEVICE_ATTRIBUTE_HANDLE_TYPE_\\n↪→POSIX_FILE_DESCRIPTOR_SUPPORTED, device));\\n#else\\n\\ncuDeviceGetAttribute(&deviceSupportsIpcHandle, CU_DEVICE_ATTRIBUTE_HANDLE_TYPE_\\n↪→WIN32_HANDLE_SUPPORTED, device));\\n#endif\\n\\nUsers should set the CUmemAllocationProp::requestedHandleTypes appropriately as shown be-\\nlow:\\n\\n#if defined(__linux__)\\nprop.requestedHandleTypes = CU_MEM_HANDLE_TYPE_POSIX_FILE_DESCRIPTOR;\\n\\n#else\\nprop.requestedHandleTypes = CU_MEM_HANDLE_TYPE_WIN32;\\nprop.win32HandleMetaData = ∕∕ Windows specific LPSECURITYATTRIBUTES attribute.\\n\\n#endif\\n\\nThe memMapIpcDrv sample can be used as an example for using IPC with Virtual Memory Manage-\\nment allocations.\\n\\n13.3. Allocating Physical Memory 341\\n\\nhttps://github.com/NVIDIA/cuda-samples/tree/master/Samples/3_CUDA_Features/memMapIPCDrv/\\n\\n\\nCUDA C++ Programming Guide, Release 12.4\\n\\n13.3.2. Memory Type\\n\\nBefore CUDA 10.2, applications had no user-controlled way of allocating any special type of memory\\nthat certain devices may support. With cuMemCreate, applications can additionally specify memory\\ntype requirements using the CUmemAllocationProp::allocFlags to opt into any specific memory\\nfeatures. Applications must also ensure that the requested memory type is supported on the device\\nof allocation.\\n\\n13.3.2.1 Compressible Memory\\n\\nCompressible memory can be used to accelerate accesses to data with unstructured spar-\\nsity and other compressible data patterns. Compression can save DRAM bandwidth, L2\\nread bandwidth and L2 capacity depending on the data being operated on. Applications\\nthat want to allocate compressible memory on devices that support Compute Data Com-\\npression can do so by setting CUmemAllocationProp::allocFlags::compressionType to\\nCU_MEM_ALLOCATION_COMP_GENERIC. Users must query if device supports Compute Data Compres-\\nsion by usingCU_DEVICE_ATTRIBUTE_GENERIC_COMPRESSION_SUPPORTED. The following code snip-\\npet illustrates querying compressible memory support cuDeviceGetAttribute.\\n\\nint compressionSupported = 0;\\ncuDeviceGetAttribute(&compressionSupported, CU_DEVICE_ATTRIBUTE_GENERIC_COMPRESSION_\\n↪→SUPPORTED, device);\\n\\nOn devices that support Compute Data Compression, users must opt in at allocation time as shown\\nbelow:\\n\\nprop.allocFlags.compressionType = CU_MEM_ALLOCATION_COMP_GENERIC;\\n\\nDue to various reasons such as limited HW resources, the allocation may not have compression at-\\ntributes, the user is expected to query back the properties of the allocated memory using cuMemGe-\\ntAllocationPropertiesFromHandle and check for compression attribute.\\n\\nCUmemAllocationPropPrivate allocationProp = {};\\ncuMemGetAllocationPropertiesFromHandle(&allocationProp, allocationHandle);\\n\\nif (allocationProp.allocFlags.compressionType == CU_MEM_ALLOCATION_COMP_GENERIC)\\n{\\n\\n∕∕ Obtained compressible memory allocation\\n}\\n\\n13.4. Reserving a Virtual Address Range\\n\\nSince with Virtual Memory Management the notions of address and memory are distinct, applications\\nmust carve out an address range that can hold the memory allocations made by cuMemCreate. The\\naddress range reserved must be at least as large as the sum of the sizes of all the physical memory\\nallocations the user plans to place in them.\\n\\nApplications can reserve a virtual address range by passing appropriate parameters to cuMemAd-\\ndressReserve. The address range obtained will not have any device or host physical memory as-\\nsociated with it. The reserved virtual address range can be mapped to memory chunks belonging to\\nany device in the system, thus providing the application a continuous VA range backed andmapped by\\n\\n342 Chapter 13. Virtual Memory Management\\n\\n\\n\\nCUDA C++ Programming Guide, Release 12.4\\n\\nmemory belonging to different devices. Applications are expected to return the virtual address range\\nback to CUDA using cuMemAddressFree. Users must ensure that the entire VA range is unmapped\\nbefore calling cuMemAddressFree. These functions are conceptually similar to mmap/munmap (on\\nLinux) or VirtualAlloc/VirtualFree (on Windows) functions. The following code snippet illustrates the\\nusage for the function:\\n\\nCUdeviceptr ptr;\\n∕∕ `ptr` holds the returned start of virtual address range reserved.\\nCUresult result = cuMemAddressReserve(&ptr, size, 0, 0, 0); ∕∕ alignment = 0 for�\\n↪→default alignment\\n\\n13.5. Virtual Aliasing Support\\n\\nThe Virtual Memory Management APIs provide a way to create multiple virtual memory mappings or\\n“proxies” to the same allocation using multiple calls to cuMemMap with different virtual addresses, so-\\ncalled virtual aliasing. Unless otherwise noted in the PTX ISA, writes to one proxy of the allocation are\\nconsidered inconsistent and incoherent with any other proxy of the same memory until the writing\\ndevice operation (grid launch, memcpy, memset, and so on) completes. Grids present on the GPU\\nprior to a writing device operation but reading after the writing device operation completes are also\\nconsidered to have inconsistent and incoherent proxies.\\n\\nFor example, the following snippet is considered undefined, assuming device pointers A and B are\\nvirtual aliases of the same memory allocation:\\n\\n__global__ void foo(char *A, char *B) {\\n*A = 0x1;\\nprintf(\"%d\\\\n\", *B); ∕∕ Undefined behavior! *B can take on either\\n\\n∕∕ the previous value or some value in-between.\\n}\\n\\nThe following is defined behavior, assuming these two kernels are ordered monotonically (by streams\\nor events).\\n\\n__global__ void foo1(char *A) {\\n*A = 0x1;\\n\\n}\\n\\n__global__ void foo2(char *B) {\\nprintf(\"%d\\\\n\", *B); ∕∕ *B == *A == 0x1 assuming foo2 waits for foo1\\n\\n∕∕ to complete before launching\\n}\\n\\ncudaMemcpyAsync(B, input, size, stream1); ∕∕ Aliases are allowed at\\n∕∕ operation boundaries\\nfoo1<<<1,1,0,stream1>>>(A); ∕∕ allowing foo1 to access A.\\ncudaEventRecord(event, stream1);\\ncudaStreamWaitEvent(stream2, event);\\nfoo2<<<1,1,0,stream2>>>(B);\\ncudaStreamWaitEvent(stream3, event);\\ncudaMemcpyAsync(output, B, size, stream3); ∕∕ Both launches of foo2 and\\n\\n∕∕ cudaMemcpy (which both\\n∕∕ read) wait for foo1 (which writes)\\n∕∕ to complete before proceeding\\n\\n13.5. Virtual Aliasing Support 343\\n\\n\\n\\nCUDA C++ Programming Guide, Release 12.4\\n\\n13.6. Mapping Memory\\n\\nThe allocated physical memory and the carved out virtual address space from the previous two sec-\\ntions represent the memory and address distinction introduced by the Virtual Memory Management\\nAPIs. For the allocated memory to be useable, the user must first place the memory in the address\\nspace. The address range obtained from cuMemAddressReserve and the physical allocation obtained\\nfrom cuMemCreate or cuMemImportFromShareableHandlemust be associated with each other by\\nusing cuMemMap.\\n\\nUsers can associate allocations from multiple devices to reside in contiguous virtual address ranges\\nas long as they have carved out enough address space. In order to decouple the physical allocation\\nand the address range, users must unmap the address of the mapping by using cuMemUnmap. Users\\ncan map and unmap memory to the same address range as many times as they want, as long as they\\nensure that they don’t attempt to create mappings on VA range reservations that are already mapped.\\nThe following code snippet illustrates the usage for the function:\\n\\nCUdeviceptr ptr;\\n∕∕ `ptr`: address in the address range previously reserved by cuMemAddressReserve.\\n∕∕ `allocHandle`: CUmemGenericAllocationHandle obtained by a previous call to�\\n↪→cuMemCreate.\\nCUresult result = cuMemMap(ptr, size, 0, allocHandle, 0);\\n\\n13.7. Controlling Access Rights\\n\\nThe Virtual Memory Management APIs enable applications to explicitly protect their VA ranges with\\naccess control mechanisms. Mapping the allocation to a region of the address range using cuMemMap\\ndoes not make the address accessible, and would result in a program crash if accessed by a CUDA\\nkernel. Users must specifically select access control using the cuMemSetAccess function, which al-\\nlows or restricts access for specific devices to a mapped address range. The following code snippet\\nillustrates the usage for the function:\\n\\nvoid setAccessOnDevice(int device, CUdeviceptr ptr, size_t size) {\\nCUmemAccessDesc accessDesc = {};\\naccessDesc.location.type = CU_MEM_LOCATION_TYPE_DEVICE;\\naccessDesc.location.id = device;\\naccessDesc.flags = CU_MEM_ACCESS_FLAGS_PROT_READWRITE;\\n\\n∕∕ Make the address accessible\\ncuMemSetAccess(ptr, size, &accessDesc, 1);\\n\\n}\\n\\nThe access control mechanism exposed with Virtual Memory Management allows users to be explicit\\nabout which allocations they want to share with other peer devices on the system. As specified earlier,\\ncudaEnablePeerAccess forces all prior and future cudaMalloc’d allocations to be mapped to the\\ntarget peer device. This can be convenient in many cases as user doesn’t have to worry about tracking\\nthe mapping state of every allocation to every device in the system. But for users concerned with\\nperformance of their applications this approach has performance implications. With access control\\nat allocation granularity Virtual Memory Management exposes a mechanism to have peer mappings\\nwith minimal overhead.\\n\\nThe vectorAddMMAP sample can be used as an example for using the Virtual Memory Management\\nAPIs.\\n\\n344 Chapter 13. Virtual Memory Management\\n\\nhttps://devblogs.nvidia.com/introducing-low-level-gpu-virtual-memory-management/\\n\\n\\nChapter 14. Stream Ordered Memory\\nAllocator\\n\\n14.1. Introduction\\n\\nManagingmemory allocations using cudaMalloc and cudaFree causes GPU to synchronize across all\\nexecuting CUDA streams. The Stream Order Memory Allocator enables applications to order memory\\nallocation and deallocation with other work launched into a CUDA stream such as kernel launches and\\nasynchronous copies. This improves application memory use by taking advantage of stream-ordering\\nsemantics to reusememory allocations. The allocator also allows applications to control the allocator’s\\nmemory caching behavior. When set up with an appropriate release threshold, the caching behavior\\nallows the allocator to avoid expensive calls into the OS when the application indicates it is willing\\nto accept a bigger memory footprint. The allocator also supports the easy and secure sharing of\\nallocations between processes.\\n\\nFor many applications, the Stream Ordered Memory Allocator reduces the need for custom memory\\nmanagement abstractions, and makes it easier to create high-performance custommemory manage-\\nment for applications that need it. For applications and libraries that already have custom memory\\nallocators, adopting the Stream Ordered Memory Allocator enables multiple libraries to share a com-\\nmon pool of memory managed by the driver, thus reducing excess memory consumption. Additionally,\\nthe driver can perform optimizations based on its awareness of the allocator and other stream man-\\nagement APIs. Finally, Nsight Compute and the Next-Gen CUDA debugger is aware of the allocator as\\npart of their CUDA 11.3 toolkit support.\\n\\n14.2. Query for Support\\n\\nThe user can determinewhether or not a device supports the streamorderedmemory allocator by call-\\ning cudaDeviceGetAttribute() with the device attribute cudaDevAttrMemoryPoolsSupported.\\n\\nStarting with CUDA 11.3, IPC memory pool support can be queried with the cudaDevAttrMemo-\\nryPoolSupportedHandleTypes device attribute. Previous drivers will return cudaErrorInvalid-\\nValue as those drivers are unaware of the attribute enum.\\n\\nint driverVersion = 0;\\nint deviceSupportsMemoryPools = 0;\\nint poolSupportedHandleTypes = 0;\\ncudaDriverGetVersion(&driverVersion);\\nif (driverVersion >= 11020) {\\n\\n(continues on next page)\\n\\n345\\n\\n\\n\\nCUDA C++ Programming Guide, Release 12.4\\n\\n(continued from previous page)\\n\\ncudaDeviceGetAttribute(&deviceSupportsMemoryPools,\\ncudaDevAttrMemoryPoolsSupported, device);\\n\\n}\\nif (deviceSupportsMemoryPools != 0) {\\n\\n∕∕ `device` supports the Stream Ordered Memory Allocator\\n}\\n\\nif (driverVersion >= 11030) {\\ncudaDeviceGetAttribute(&poolSupportedHandleTypes,\\n\\ncudaDevAttrMemoryPoolSupportedHandleTypes, device);\\n}\\nif (poolSupportedHandleTypes & cudaMemHandleTypePosixFileDescriptor) {\\n\\n∕∕ Pools on the specified device can be created with posix file descriptor-based IPC\\n}\\n\\nPerforming the driver version check before the query avoids hitting a cudaErrorInvalidValue error\\non drivers where the attribute was not yet defined. One can use cudaGetLastError to clear the error\\ninstead of avoiding it.\\n\\n14.3. API Fundamentals (cudaMallocAsync and\\ncudaFreeAsync)\\n\\nThe APIs cudaMallocAsync and cudaFreeAsync form the core of the allocator. cudaMallocAsync\\nreturns an allocation and cudaFreeAsync frees an allocation. Both APIs accept stream arguments to\\ndefine when the allocation will become and stop being available for use. The pointer value returned\\nby cudaMallocAsync is determined synchronously and is available for constructing future work. It\\nis important to note that cudaMallocAsync ignores the current device/context when determining\\nwhere the allocation will reside. Instead, cudaMallocAsync determines the resident device based on\\nthe specified memory pool or the supplied stream. The simplest use pattern is when the memory is\\nallocated, used, and freed back into the same stream.\\n\\nvoid *ptr;\\nsize_t size = 512;\\ncudaMallocAsync(&ptr, size, cudaStreamPerThread);\\n∕∕ do work using the allocation\\nkernel<<<..., cudaStreamPerThread>>>(ptr, ...);\\n∕∕ An asynchronous free can be specified without synchronizing the cpu and GPU\\ncudaFreeAsync(ptr, cudaStreamPerThread);\\n\\nWhen using an allocation in a stream other than the allocating stream, the user must guarantee that\\nthe access will happen after the allocation operation, otherwise the behavior is undefined. The user\\nmay make this guarantee either by synchronizing the allocating stream, or by using CUDA events to\\nsynchronize the producing and consuming streams.\\n\\ncudaFreeAsync() inserts a free operation into the stream. The user must guarantee that the free\\noperation happens after the allocation operation and any use of the allocation. Also, any use of the\\nallocation after the free operation starts results in undefined behavior. Events and/or stream syn-\\nchronizing operations should be used to guarantee any access to the allocation on other streams is\\ncomplete before the freeing stream begins the free operation.\\n\\n346 Chapter 14. Stream Ordered Memory Allocator\\n\\n\\n\\nCUDA C++ Programming Guide, Release 12.4\\n\\ncudaMallocAsync(&ptr, size, stream1);\\ncudaEventRecord(event1, stream1);\\n∕∕stream2 must wait for the allocation to be ready before accessing\\ncudaStreamWaitEvent(stream2, event1);\\nkernel<<<..., stream2>>>(ptr, ...);\\ncudaEventRecord(event2, stream2);\\n∕∕ stream3 must wait for stream2 to finish accessing the allocation before\\n∕∕ freeing the allocation\\ncudaStreamWaitEvent(stream3, event2);\\ncudaFreeAsync(ptr, stream3);\\n\\nThe user can free allocations allocated with cudaMalloc() with cudaFreeAsync(). The user must\\nmake the same guarantees about accesses being complete before the free operation begins.\\n\\ncudaMalloc(&ptr, size);\\nkernel<<<..., stream>>>(ptr, ...);\\ncudaFreeAsync(ptr, stream);\\n\\nThe user can free memory allocated with cudaMallocAsync with cudaFree(). When freeing such\\nallocations through the cudaFree() API, the driver assumes that all accesses to the allocation are\\ncomplete and performs no further synchronization. The user can use cudaStreamQuery / cudaS-\\ntreamSynchronize / cudaEventQuery / cudaEventSynchronize / cudaDeviceSynchronize to\\nguarantee that the appropriate asynchronous work is complete and that the GPU will not try to ac-\\ncess the allocation.\\n\\ncudaMallocAsync(&ptr, size,stream);\\nkernel<<<..., stream>>>(ptr, ...);\\n∕∕ synchronize is needed to avoid prematurely freeing the memory\\ncudaStreamSynchronize(stream);\\ncudaFree(ptr);\\n\\n14.4. Memory Pools and the cudaMemPool_t\\n\\nMemory pools encapsulate virtual address and physical memory resources that are allocated andman-\\naged according to the pools attributes and properties. The primary aspect of a memory pool is the\\nkind and location of memory it manages.\\n\\nAll calls to cudaMallocAsync use the resources of a memory pool. In the absence of a specified\\nmemory pool, cudaMallocAsync uses the current memory pool of the supplied stream’s device. The\\ncurrentmemory pool for a devicemay be setwith cudaDeviceSetMempool and queriedwith cudaDe-\\nviceGetMempool. By default (in the absence of a cudaDeviceSetMempool call), the current memory\\npool is the default memory pool of a device. The API cudaMallocFromPoolAsync and c++ overloads\\nof cudaMallocAsync allow a user to specify the pool to be used for an allocation without setting it as\\nthe current pool. The APIs cudaDeviceGetDefaultMempool and cudaMemPoolCreate give users\\nhandles to memory pools.\\n\\nNote: The mempool current to a device will be local to that device. So allocating without specifying a\\nmemory pool will always yield an allocation local to the stream’s device.\\n\\nNote: cudaMemPoolSetAttribute and cudaMemPoolGetAttribute control the attributes of the\\n\\n14.4.

Default/Implicit Pools\\n\\nThe default memory pool of a devicemay be retrieved with the cudaDeviceGetDefaultMempool API.\\nAllocations from the default memory pool of a device are non-migratable device allocation located on\\nthat device. These allocations will always be accessible from that device. The accessibility of the\\ndefault memory pool may be modified with cudaMemPoolSetAccess and queried by cudaMemPool-\\nGetAccess. Since the default pools do not need to be explicitly created, they are sometimes referred\\nto as implicit pools. The default memory pool of a device does not support IPC.\\n\\n14.6.

Physical Page Caching Behavior\\n\\nBy default, the allocator tries to minimize the physical memory owned by a pool. To mini-\\nmize the OS calls to allocate and free physical memory, applications must configure a mem-\\nory footprint for each pool. Applications can do this with the release threshold attribute\\n(cudaMemPoolAttrReleaseThreshold).\\n\\nThe release threshold is the amount of memory in bytes a pool should hold onto before trying to\\nrelease memory back to the OS. When more than the release threshold bytes of memory are held by\\nthe memory pool, the allocator will try to release memory back to the OS on the next call to stream,\\nevent or device synchronize.

Memory Reuse Policies\\n\\nIn order to service an allocation request, the driver attempts to reuse memory that was previously\\nfreed via cudaFreeAsync() before attempting to allocate more memory from the OS. For example,\\nmemory freed in a stream can immediately be reused for a subsequent allocation request in the same\\nstream. Similarly, when a stream is synchronized with the CPU, the memory that was previously freed\\nin that stream becomes available for reuse for an allocation in any stream.\\n\\nThe stream ordered allocator has a few controllable allocation policies. The pool attributes cud-\\naMemPoolReuseFollowEventDependencies, cudaMemPoolReuseAllowOpportunistic, and cu-\\ndaMemPoolReuseAllowInternalDependencies control these policies. Upgrading to a newer CUDA\\n\\n350 Chapter 14. Stream Ordered Memory Allocator\\n\\n\\n\\nCUDA C++ Programming Guide, Release 12.4\\n\\ndriver may change, enhance, augment and/or reorder the reuse policies.\\n\\n14.9.1. cudaMemPoolReuseFollowEventDependencies\\n\\nBefore allocating more physical GPU memory, the allocator examines dependency information estab-\\nlished by CUDA events and tries to allocate from memory freed in another stream.\\n\\ncudaMallocAsync(&ptr, size, originalStream);\\nkernel<<<..., originalStream>>>(ptr, ...);\\ncudaFreeAsync(ptr, originalStream);\\ncudaEventRecord(event,originalStream);\\n\\n∕∕ waiting on the event that captures the free in another stream\\n∕∕ allows the allocator to reuse the memory to satisfy\\n∕∕ a new allocation request in the other stream when\\n∕∕ cudaMemPoolReuseFollowEventDependencies is enabled.\\ncudaStreamWaitEvent(otherStream, event);\\ncudaMallocAsync(&ptr2, size, otherStream);\\n\\n14.9.2. cudaMemPoolReuseAllowOpportunistic\\n\\nAccording to the cudaMemPoolReuseAllowOpportunistic policy, the allocator examines freed al-\\nlocations to see if the free’s stream order semantic has been met (such as the stream has passed the\\npoint of execution indicated by the free). When this is disabled, the allocator will still reuse memory\\nmade available when a stream is synchronized with the CPU. Disabling this policy does not stop the\\ncudaMemPoolReuseFollowEventDependencies from applying.\\n\\ncudaMallocAsync(&ptr, size, originalStream);\\nkernel<<<..., originalStream>>>(ptr, ...);\\ncudaFreeAsync(ptr, originalStream);\\n\\n∕∕ after some time, the kernel finishes running\\nwait(10);\\n\\n∕∕ When cudaMemPoolReuseAllowOpportunistic is enabled this allocation request\\n∕∕ can be fulfilled with the prior allocation based on the progress of originalStream.\\ncudaMallocAsync(&ptr2, size, otherStream);\\n\\n14.9.3. cudaMemPoolReuseAllowInternalDependencies\\n\\nFailing to allocate and map more physical memory from the OS, the driver will look for memory whose\\navailability depends on another stream’s pending progress. If such memory is found, the driver will\\ninsert the required dependency into the allocating stream and reuse the memory.\\n\\ncudaMallocAsync(&ptr, size, originalStream);\\nkernel<<<..., originalStream>>>(ptr, ...);\\ncudaFreeAsync(ptr, originalStream);\\n\\n(continues on next page)\\n\\n14.9.

Disabling Reuse Policies\\n\\nWhile the controllable reuse policies improve memory reuse, users may want to disable them. Allow-\\ning opportunistic reuse (such as cudaMemPoolReuseAllowOpportunistic) introduces run to run\\nvariance in allocation patterns based on the interleaving of CPU and GPU execution. Internal depen-\\ndency insertion (such as cudaMemPoolReuseAllowInternalDependencies) can serialize work in\\nunexpected and potentially non-deterministic ways when the user would rather explicitly synchronize\\nan event or stream on allocation failure.\\n\\n14.10. Device Accessibility for Multi-GPU\\nSupport\\n\\nJust like allocation accessibility controlled through the virtual memory management APIs, memory\\npool allocation accessibility does not follow cudaDeviceEnablePeerAccess or cuCtxEnablePeer-\\nAccess. Instead, the API cudaMemPoolSetAccessmodifieswhat devices can access allocations from\\na pool. By default, allocations are accessible from the device where the allocations are located. This\\naccess cannot be revoked. To enable access from other devices, the accessing device must be peer\\ncapable with the memory pool’s device; check with cudaDeviceCanAccessPeer. If the peer capabil-\\nity is not checked, the set access may fail with cudaErrorInvalidDevice. If no allocations had been\\nmade from the pool, the cudaMemPoolSetAccess call may succeed even when the devices are not\\npeer capable; in this case, the next allocation from the pool will fail.\\n\\nIt is worth noting that cudaMemPoolSetAccess affects all allocations from the memory pool, not just\\nfuture ones. Also the accessibility reported by cudaMemPoolGetAccess applies to all allocations from\\nthe pool, not just future ones. It is recommended that the accessibility settings of a pool for a given\\nGPU not be changed frequently; once a pool is made accessible from a given GPU, it should remain\\naccessible from that GPU for the lifetime of the pool.\\n\\n∕∕ snippet showing usage of cudaMemPoolSetAccess:\\ncudaError_t setAccessOnDevice(cudaMemPool_t memPool, int residentDevice,\\n\\nint accessingDevice) {\\ncudaMemAccessDesc accessDesc = {};\\naccessDesc.location.type = cudaMemLocationTypeDevice;\\naccessDesc.location.id = accessingDevice;\\naccessDesc.flags = cudaMemAccessFlagsProtReadWrite;\\n\\nint canAccess = 0;\\ncudaError_t error = cudaDeviceCanAccessPeer(&canAccess, accessingDevice,\\n\\nresidentDevice);\\nif (error != cudaSuccess) {\\n\\nreturn error;\\n(continues on next page)\\n\\n352 Chapter 14.

IPC Memory Pools\\n\\nIPC capablememory pools allow easy, efficient and secure sharing of GPUmemory between processes.\\nCUDA’s IPC memory pools provide the same security benefits as CUDA’s virtual memory management\\nAPIs.\\n\\nThere are two phases to sharing memory between processes with memory pools. The processes first\\nneed to share access to the pool, then share specific allocations from that pool. The first phase estab-\\nlishes and enforces security. The second phase coordinates what virtual addresses are used in each\\nprocess and when mappings need to be valid in the importing process.\\n\\n14.11.1. Creating and Sharing IPC Memory Pools\\n\\nSharing access to a pool involves retrieving an OS native handle to the pool (with the cudaMem-\\nPoolExportToShareableHandle() API), transferring the handle to the importing process using\\nthe usual OS native IPC mechanisms, and creating an imported memory pool (with the cudaMem-\\nPoolImportFromShareableHandle() API). For cudaMemPoolExportToShareableHandle to suc-\\nceed, the memory pool had to be created with the requested handle type specified in the pool proper-\\nties structure. Please reference samples for the appropriate IPCmechanisms to transfer the OS native\\nhandle between processes. The rest of the procedure can be found in the following code snippets.\\n\\n∕∕ in exporting process\\n∕∕ create an exportable IPC capable pool on device 0\\ncudaMemPoolProps poolProps = { };\\npoolProps.allocType = cudaMemAllocationTypePinned;\\npoolProps.location.id = 0;\\npoolProps.location.type = cudaMemLocationTypeDevice;\\n\\n∕∕ Setting handleTypes to a non zero value will make the pool exportable (IPC capable)\\npoolProps.handleTypes = CU_MEM_HANDLE_TYPE_POSIX_FILE_DESCRIPTOR;\\n\\ncudaMemPoolCreate(&memPool, &poolProps));\\n\\n∕∕ FD based handles are integer types\\nint fdHandle = 0;\\n\\n∕∕ Retrieve an OS native handle to the pool.\\n∕∕ Note that a pointer to the handle memory is passed in here.\\ncudaMemPoolExportToShareableHandle(&fdHandle,\\n\\nmemPool,\\n(continues on next page)\\n\\n14.11.

Set Access in the Importing Process\\n\\nImported memory pools are initially only accessible from their resident device. The imported memory\\npool does not inherit any accessibility set by the exporting process. The importing process needs to\\nenable access (with cudaMemPoolSetAccess) from any GPU it plans to access the memory from.\\n\\nIf the imported memory pool belongs to a non-visible device in the importing process, the user must\\nuse the cudaMemPoolSetAccess API to enable access from the GPUs the allocations will be used on.\\n\\n14.11.3. Creating and Sharing Allocations from an\\nExported Pool\\n\\nOnce the pool has been shared, allocations made with cudaMallocAsync() from the pool in the ex-\\nporting process can be shared with other processes that have imported the pool. Since the pool’s\\nsecurity policy is established and verified at the pool level, the OS does not need extra bookkeeping to\\nprovide security for specific pool allocations; In other words, the opaque cudaMemPoolPtrExport-\\nData required to import a pool allocation may be sent to the importing process using any mechanism.\\n\\nWhile allocationsmaybe exported and even importedwithout synchronizingwith the allocating stream\\nin any way, the importing processmust follow the same rules as the exporting process when accessing\\nthe allocation. Namely, access to the allocation must happen after the stream ordering of the allo-\\ncation operation in the allocating stream. The two following code snippets show cudaMemPoolEx-\\nportPointer() and cudaMemPoolImportPointer() sharing the allocation with an IPC event used\\nto guarantee that the allocation isn’t accessed in the importing process before the allocation is ready.\\n\\n∕∕ preparing an allocation in the exporting process\\ncudaMemPoolPtrExportData exportData;\\ncudaEvent_t readyIpcEvent;\\ncudaIpcEventHandle_t readyIpcEventHandle;\\n\\n∕∕ ipc event for coordinating between processes\\n∕∕ cudaEventInterprocess flag makes the event an ipc event\\n\\n(continues on next page)\\n\\n354 Chapter 14.

Synchronization API Actions\\n\\nOne of the optimizations that comes with the allocator being part of the CUDA driver is integration\\nwith the synchronize APIs.

Before returning, the driver will determine what frees the syn-\\nchronization guaranteed to be completed. These allocations are made available for allocation regard-\\nless of specified stream or disabled allocation policies. The driver also checks cudaMemPoolAttrRe-\\nleaseThreshold here and releases any excess physical memory that it can.\\n\\n356 Chapter 14.

Introduction\\n\\nGraph memory nodes allow graphs to create and own memory allocations. Graph memory nodes have\\nGPU ordered lifetime semantics, which dictate when memory is allowed to be accessed on the device.\\nThese GPU ordered lifetime semantics enable driver-managed memory reuse, and match those of the\\nstream ordered allocation APIs cudaMallocAsync and cudaFreeAsync, whichmay be capturedwhen\\ncreating a graph.\\n\\nGraph allocations have fixed addresses over the life of a graph including repeated instantiations and\\nlaunches. This allows the memory to be directly referenced by other operations within the graph with-\\nout the need of a graph update, even when CUDA changes the backing physical memory. Within a\\ngraph, allocations whose graph ordered lifetimes do not overlap may use the same underlying physical\\nmemory.\\n\\nCUDA may reuse the same physical memory for allocations across multiple graphs, aliasing virtual ad-\\ndress mappings according to the GPU ordered lifetime semantics. For example when different graphs\\nare launched into the same stream, CUDA may virtually alias the same physical memory to satisfy the\\nneeds of allocations which have single-graph lifetimes.\\n\\n15.2. Support and Compatibility\\n\\nGraphmemory nodes require an11.4 capableCUDAdriver and support for the streamordered allocator\\non the GPU. The following snippet shows how to check for support on a given device.\\n\\nint driverVersion = 0;\\nint deviceSupportsMemoryPools = 0;\\nint deviceSupportsMemoryNodes = 0;\\ncudaDriverGetVersion(&driverVersion);\\nif (driverVersion >= 11020) { ∕∕ avoid invalid value error in cudaDeviceGetAttribute\\n\\ncudaDeviceGetAttribute(&deviceSupportsMemoryPools,�\\n↪→cudaDevAttrMemoryPoolsSupported, device);\\n}\\ndeviceSupportsMemoryNodes = (driverVersion >= 11040) && (deviceSupportsMemoryPools !=�\\n↪→0);\\n\\nDoing the attribute query inside the driver version check avoids an invalid value return code on 11.0\\nand 11.1 drivers. Be aware that the compute sanitizer emits warnings when it detects CUDA returning\\nerror codes, and a version check before reading the attribute will avoid this. Graph memory nodes are\\nonly supported on driver versions 11.4 and newer.\\n\\n359\\n\\n\\n\\nCUDA C++ Programming Guide, Release 12.4\\n\\n15.3. API Fundamentals\\n\\nGraph memory nodes are graph nodes representing either memory allocation or free actions. As a\\nshorthand, nodes that allocate memory are called allocation nodes. Likewise, nodes that free memory\\nare called free nodes. Allocations created by allocation nodes are called graph allocations. CUDA as-\\nsigns virtual addresses for the graph allocation at node creation time. While these virtual addresses\\nare fixed for the lifetime of the allocation node, the allocation contents are not persistent past the\\nfreeing operation and may be overwritten by accesses referring to a different allocation.\\n\\nGraph allocations are considered recreated every time a graph runs. A graph allocation’s lifetime, which\\ndiffers from the node’s lifetime, begins when GPU execution reaches the allocating graph node and\\nends when one of the following occurs:\\n\\n▶ GPU execution reaches the freeing graph node\\n\\n▶ GPU execution reaches the freeing cudaFreeAsync() stream call\\n\\n▶ immediately upon the freeing call to cudaFree()\\n\\nNote: Graph destruction does not automatically free any live graph-allocated memory, even though it\\nends the lifetime of the allocation node. The allocation must subsequently be freed in another graph,\\nor using cudaFreeAsync()∕cudaFree().\\n\\nJust like other graph nodes, graph memory nodes are ordered within a graph by dependency edges. A\\nprogram must guarantee that operations accessing graph memory:\\n\\n▶ are ordered after the allocation node\\n\\n▶ are ordered before the operation freeing the memory\\n\\nGraph allocation lifetimes begin and usually end according to GPU execution (as opposed to API invo-\\ncation). GPU ordering is the order that work runs on the GPU as opposed to the order that the work\\nis enqueued or described. Thus, graph allocations are considered ‘GPU ordered.’\\n\\n15.3.1. Graph Node APIs\\n\\nGraph memory nodes may be explicitly created with the memory node creation APIs, cudaGraphAd-\\ndMemAllocNode and cudaGraphAddMemFreeNode. The address allocated by cudaGraphAddMemAl-\\nlocNode is returned to the user in the dptr field of the passed CUDA_MEM_ALLOC_NODE_PARAMS\\nstructure. All operations using graph allocations inside the allocating graph must be ordered after the\\nallocating node. Similarly, any free nodes must be ordered after all uses of the allocation within the\\ngraph. cudaGraphAddMemFreeNode creates free nodes.\\n\\nIn the following figure, there is an example graph with an alloc and a free node. Kernel nodes a, b,\\nand c are ordered after the allocation node and before the free node such that the kernels can access\\nthe allocation. Kernel node e is not ordered after the alloc node and therefore cannot safely access\\nthe memory. Kernel node d is not ordered before the free node, therefore it cannot safely access the\\nmemory.\\n\\nThe following code snippet establishes the graph in this figure:\\n\\n∕∕ Create the graph - it starts out empty\\ncudaGraphCreate(&graph, 0);\\n\\n(continues on next page)\\n\\n360 Chapter 15.

Stream Capture\\n\\nGraph memory nodes can be created by capturing the corresponding stream ordered allocation and\\nfree calls cudaMallocAsync and cudaFreeAsync. In this case, the virtual addresses returned by the\\ncaptured allocation API can be used by other operations inside the graph. Since the stream ordered\\ndependencies will be captured into the graph, the ordering requirements of the stream ordered al-\\nlocation APIs guarantee that the graph memory nodes will be properly ordered with respect to the\\ncaptured stream operations (for correctly written stream code).\\n\\nIgnoring kernel nodes d and e, for clarity, the following code snippet shows how to use stream capture\\nto create the graph from the previous figure:\\n\\ncudaMallocAsync(&dptr, size, stream1);\\nkernel_A<<< ..., stream1 >>>(dptr, ...);\\n\\n∕∕ Fork into stream2\\ncudaEventRecord(event1, stream1);\\ncudaStreamWaitEvent(stream2, event1);\\n\\nkernel_B<<< ..., stream1 >>>(dptr, ...);\\n∕∕ event dependencies translated into graph dependencies, so the kernel node created�\\n↪→by the capture of kernel C will depend on the allocation node created by capturing�\\n↪→the cudaMallocAsync call.\\nkernel_C<<< ..., stream2 >>>(dptr, ...);\\n\\n(continues on next page)\\n\\n362 Chapter 15.

Accessing and Freeing Graph Memory Outside of\\nthe Allocating Graph\\n\\nGraph allocations do not have to be freed by the allocating graph. When a graph does not free an allo-\\ncation, that allocation persists beyond the execution of the graph and can be accessed by subsequent\\nCUDA operations. These allocationsmay be accessed in another graph or directly using a stream oper-\\nation as long as the accessing operation is ordered after the allocation through CUDA events and other\\nstream ordering mechanisms. An allocation may subsequently be freed by regular calls to cudaFree,\\ncudaFreeAsync, or by the launch of another graph with a corresponding free node, or a subsequent\\nlaunch of the allocating graph (if it was instantiated with the cudaGraphInstantiateFlagAutoFreeOn-\\nLaunch flag). It is illegal to accessmemory after it has been freed - the free operationmust be ordered\\nafter all operations accessing the memory using graph dependencies, CUDA events, and other stream\\nordering mechanisms.\\n\\nNote: Because graph allocations may share underlying physical memory with each other, the Virtual\\nAliasing Support rules relating to consistency and coherency must be considered. Simply put, the free\\noperation must be ordered after the full device operation (for example, compute kernel / memcpy)\\ncompletes. Specifically, out of band synchronization - for example a handshake through memory as\\npart of a compute kernel that accesses the graph-allocated memory - is not sufficient for providing\\nordering guarantees between the memory writes to graph memory and the free operation of that\\ngraph memory.\\n\\nThe following code snippets demonstrate accessing graph allocations outside of the allocating graph\\nwith ordering properly established by: using a single stream, using events between streams, and using\\nevents baked into the allocating and freeing graph.\\n\\nOrdering established by using a single stream:\\n\\nvoid *dptr;\\ncudaGraphAddMemAllocNode(&allocNode, allocGraph, NULL, 0, &params);\\ndptr = params.dptr;\\n\\ncudaGraphInstantiate(&allocGraphExec, allocGraph, NULL, NULL, 0);\\n\\ncudaGraphLaunch(allocGraphExec, stream);\\nkernel<<< …, stream >>>(dptr, …);\\ncudaFreeAsync(dptr, stream);\\n\\nOrdering established by recording and waiting on CUDA events:\\n\\n15.3.

Instantiat-\\ning a graph with the cudaGraphInstantiateFlagAutoFreeOnLaunch flag allows the graph to be\\nrelaunched while it still has unfreed allocations. In this case, the launch automatically inserts an asyn-\\nchronous free of the unfreed allocations.\\n\\nAuto free on launch is useful for single-producer multiple-consumer algorithms. At each iteration, a\\nproducer graph creates several allocations, and, depending on runtime conditions, a varying set of con-\\nsumers accesses those allocations. This type of variable execution sequence means that consumers\\ncannot free the allocations because a subsequent consumer may require access. Auto free on launch\\nmeans that the launch loop does not need to track the producer’s allocations - instead, that informa-\\ntion remains isolated to the producer’s creation and destruction logic. In general, auto free on launch\\nsimplifies an algorithmwhich would otherwise need to free all the allocations owned by a graph before\\neach relaunch.\\n\\nNote: The cudaGraphInstantiateFlagAutoFreeOnLaunch flag does not change the behavior of\\ngraph destruction. The application must explicitly free the unfreed memory in order to avoid memory\\nleaks, even for graphs instantiated with the flag. The following code shows the use of cudaGraphIn-\\nstantiateFlagAutoFreeOnLaunch to simplify a single-producer / multiple-consumer algorithm:\\n\\n∕∕ Create producer graph which allocates memory and populates it with data\\ncudaStreamBeginCapture(cudaStreamPerThread, cudaStreamCaptureModeGlobal);\\ncudaMallocAsync(&data1, blocks * threads, cudaStreamPerThread);\\ncudaMallocAsync(&data2, blocks * threads, cudaStreamPerThread);\\nproduce<<<blocks, threads, 0, cudaStreamPerThread>>>(data1, data2);\\n...\\ncudaStreamEndCapture(cudaStreamPerThread, &graph);\\ncudaGraphInstantiateWithFlags(&producer,\\n\\n(continues on next page)\\n\\n15.3.

Optimized Memory Reuse\\n\\nCUDA reuses memory in two ways:\\n\\n▶ Virtual and physical memory reuse within a graph is based on virtual address assignment, like in\\nthe stream ordered allocator.\\n\\n▶ Physical memory reuse between graphs is done with virtual aliasing: different graphs can map\\nthe same physical memory to their unique virtual addresses.\\n\\n366 Chapter 15. Graph Memory Nodes\\n\\n\\n\\nCUDA C++ Programming Guide, Release 12.4\\n\\n15.4.1. Address Reuse within a Graph\\n\\nCUDA may reuse memory within a graph by assigning the same virtual address ranges to different\\nallocations whose lifetimes do not overlap. Since virtual addressesmay be reused, pointers to different\\nallocations with disjoint lifetimes are not guaranteed to be unique.\\n\\nThe following figure shows adding a new allocation node (2) that can reuse the address freed by a\\ndependent node (1).\\n\\nFigure 29: Adding New Alloc Node 2\\nThe following figure shows adding a new alloc node (4). The new alloc node is not dependent on the free node (2)\\nso cannot reuse the address from the associated alloc node (2). If the alloc node (2) used the address freed by\\n\\nfree node (1), the new alloc node 3 would need a new address.\\n\\n15.4.2. Physical Memory Management and Sharing\\n\\nCUDA is responsible for mapping physical memory to the virtual address before the allocating node\\nis reached in GPU order. As an optimization for memory footprint and mapping overhead, multiple\\ngraphs may use the same physical memory for distinct allocations if they will not run simultaneously;\\nhowever, physical pages cannot be reused if they are bound to more than one executing graph at the\\nsame time, or to a graph allocation which remains unfreed.\\n\\nCUDA may update physical memory mappings at any time during graph instantiation, launch, or exe-\\ncution. CUDA may also introduce synchronization between future graph launches in order to prevent\\nlive graph allocations from referring to the same physical memory. As for any allocate-free-allocate\\n\\n15.4. Optimized Memory Reuse 367\\n\\n\\n\\nCUDA C++ Programming Guide, Release 12.4\\n\\nFigure 30: Adding New Alloc Node 3\\n\\n368 Chapter 15.

Use of compute sanitizer tools can catch this error.\\n\\nThe following figure shows graphs sequentially launched in the same stream. In this example, each\\ngraph frees all the memory it allocates. Since the graphs in the same stream never run concurrently,\\nCUDA can and should use the same physical memory to satisfy all the allocations.\\n\\nFigure 31: Sequentially Launched Graphs\\n\\n15.4. Optimized Memory Reuse 369\\n\\n\\n\\nCUDA C++ Programming Guide, Release 12.4\\n\\n15.5. Performance Considerations\\n\\nWhen multiple graphs are launched into the same stream, CUDA attempts to allocate the same phys-\\nical memory to them because the execution of these graphs cannot overlap. Physical mappings for a\\ngraph are retained between launches as an optimization to avoid the cost of remapping. If, at a later\\ntime, one of the graphs is launched such that its execution may overlap with the others (for example if\\nit is launched into a different stream) then CUDA must perform some remapping because concurrent\\ngraphs require distinct memory to avoid data corruption.\\n\\nIn general, remapping of graph memory in CUDA is likely caused by these operations:\\n\\n▶ Changing the stream into which a graph is launched\\n\\n▶ A trim operation on the graph memory pool, which explicitly frees unused memory (discussed in\\nPhysical Memory Footprint)\\n\\n▶ Relaunching a graphwhile an unfreed allocation fromanother graph ismapped to the samemem-\\nory will cause a remap of memory before relaunch\\n\\nRemappingmust happen in execution order, but after any previous execution of that graph is complete\\n(otherwise memory that is still in use could be unmapped). Due to this ordering dependency, as well as\\nbecausemapping operations areOS calls, mapping operations can be relatively expensive. Applications\\ncan avoid this cost by launching graphs containing allocationmemory nodes consistently into the same\\nstream.\\n\\n15.5.1. First Launch / cudaGraphUpload\\n\\nPhysical memory cannot be allocated or mapped during graph instantiation because the stream in\\nwhich the graph will execute is unknown. Mapping is done instead during graph launch. Calling cud-\\naGraphUpload can separate out the cost of allocation from the launch by performing all mappings\\nfor that graph immediately and associating the graph with the upload stream. If the graph is then\\nlaunched into the same stream, it will launch without any additional remapping.\\n\\nUsing different streams for graph upload and graph launch behaves similarly to switching streams,\\nlikely resulting in remap operations. In addition, unrelated memory pool management is permitted to\\npull memory from an idle stream, which could negate the impact of the uploads.\\n\\n15.6. Physical Memory Footprint\\n\\nThe pool-management behavior of asynchronous allocationmeans that destroying a graph which con-\\ntains memory nodes (even if their allocations are free) will not immediately return physical memory to\\nthe OS for use by other processes. To explicitly release memory back to the OS, an application should\\nuse the cudaDeviceGraphMemTrim API.\\n\\ncudaDeviceGraphMemTrim will unmap and release any physical memory reserved by graph memory\\nnodes that is not actively in use. Allocations that have not been freed and graphs that are sched-\\nuled or running are considered to be actively using the physical memory and will not be impacted.\\nUse of the trim API will make physical memory available to other allocation APIs and other applica-\\ntions or processes, but will cause CUDA to reallocate and remap memory when the trimmed graphs\\nare next launched. Note that cudaDeviceGraphMemTrim operates on a different pool from cudaMem-\\nPoolTrimTo(). The graphmemory pool is not exposed to the steam orderedmemory allocator. CUDA\\n\\n370 Chapter 15. Graph Memory Nodes\\n\\nindex.html#graph-memory-nodes-physical-memory-footprint\\n\\n\\nCUDA C++ Programming Guide, Release 12.4\\n\\nallows applications to query their graphmemory footprint through the cudaDeviceGetGraphMemAt-\\ntribute API. Querying the attribute cudaGraphMemAttrReservedMemCurrent returns the amount\\nof physical memory reserved by the driver for graph allocations in the current process. Querying cud-\\naGraphMemAttrUsedMemCurrent returns the amount of physical memory currently mapped by at\\nleast one graph. Either of these attributes can be used to track when new physical memory is ac-\\nquired by CUDA for the sake of an allocating graph. Both of these attributes are useful for examining\\nhow much memory is saved by the sharing mechanism.\\n\\n15.7. Peer Access\\n\\nGraph allocations can be configured for access from multiple GPUs, in which case CUDA will map the\\nallocations onto the peer GPUs as required. CUDA allows graph allocations requiring different map-\\npings to reuse the same virtual address. When this occurs, the address range is mapped onto all GPUs\\nrequired by the different allocations. This means an allocation may sometimes allowmore peer access\\nthan was requested during its creation; however, relying on these extra mappings is still an error.\\n\\n15.7.1. Peer Access with Graph Node APIs\\n\\nThe cudaGraphAddMemAllocNode API accepts mapping requests in the accessDescs array field of\\nthe node parameters structures. The poolProps.location embedded structure specifies the res-\\nident device for the allocation.

They are faster as they\\nmap to fewer native instructions. The compiler has an option (-use_fast_math) that forces each\\nfunction in Table 15 to compile to its intrinsic counterpart. In addition to reducing the accuracy of\\nthe affected functions, it may also cause some differences in special case handling. A more robust\\napproach is to selectively replacemathematical function calls by calls to intrinsic functions only where\\nit is merited by the performance gains and where changed properties such as reduced accuracy and\\ndifferent special case handling can be tolerated.\\n\\nTable 15: Functions Affected by -use_fast_math\\n\\nOperator/Function Device Function\\n\\nx∕y __fdividef(x,y)\\n\\nsinf(x) __sinf(x)\\n\\ncosf(x) __cosf(x)\\n\\ntanf(x) __tanf(x)\\n\\nsincosf(x,sptr,cptr) __sincosf(x,sptr,cptr)\\n\\nlogf(x) __logf(x)\\n\\nlog2f(x) __log2f(x)\\n\\nlog10f(x) __log10f(x)\\n\\nexpf(x) __expf(x)\\n\\nexp10f(x) __exp10f(x)\\n\\npowf(x,y) __powf(x,y)\\n\\nSingle-Precision Floating-Point Functions\\n\\n380 Chapter 16.

The input source code is processed according to the C++ ISO/IEC\\n14882:2003, C++ ISO/IEC 14882:2011, C++ ISO/IEC 14882:2014 or C++ ISO/IEC 14882:2017 specifi-\\ncations, and the CUDA front-end compiler aims to emulate any host compiler divergences from the\\nISO specification. In addition, the supported language is extended with CUDA-specific constructs de-\\nscribed in this document?, and is subject to the restrictions described below.\\n\\nC++11 Language Features, C++14 Language Features and C++17 Language Features provide support\\nmatrices for the C++11, C++14, C++17 and C++20 features, respectively. Restrictions lists the lan-\\nguage restrictions. Polymorphic Function Wrappers and Extended Lambdas describe additional fea-\\ntures. Code Samples gives code samples.\\n\\n17.1.

Host Compiler Extensions\\n\\nHost compiler specific language extensions are not supported in device code.\\n\\n__Complex types are only supported in host code.\\n\\n__int128 type is supported in device code when compiled in conjunction with a host compiler that\\nsupports it.\\n\\n__float128 type is only supported in host code on 64-bit x86 Linux platforms. A constant expression\\nof __float128 type may be processed by the compiler in a floating point representation with lower\\nprecision.\\n\\n17.5.2. Preprocessor Symbols\\n\\n17.5.2.1 __CUDA_ARCH__\\n\\n1. The type signature of the following entities shall not depend on whether __CUDA_ARCH__ is de-\\nfined or not, or on a particular value of __CUDA_ARCH__:\\n\\n▶ __global__ functions and function templates\\n\\n▶ __device__ and __constant__ variables\\n\\n▶ textures and surfaces\\n\\nExample:\\n\\n#if !defined(__CUDA_ARCH__)\\ntypedef int mytype;\\n#else\\ntypedef double mytype;\\n#endif\\n\\n__device__ mytype xxx; ∕∕ error: xxx\\'s type depends on __CUDA_ARCH__\\n__global__ void foo(mytype in, ∕∕ error: foo\\'s type depends on __CUDA_ARCH__\\n\\nmytype *ptr)\\n{\\n\\n*ptr = in;\\n}\\n\\n2. If a __global__ function template is instantiated and launched from the host, then the func-\\ntion template must be instantiated with the same template arguments irrespective of whether\\n__CUDA_ARCH__ is defined and regardless of the value of __CUDA_ARCH__.\\n\\n17.4. C++20 Language Features 389\\n\\nindex.html#cpp20\\n\\n\\nCUDA C++ Programming Guide, Release 12.4\\n\\nExample:\\n\\n__device__ int result;\\ntemplate <typename T>\\n__global__ void kern(T in)\\n{\\n\\nresult = in;\\n}\\n\\n__host__ __device__ void foo(void)\\n{\\n#if !defined(__CUDA_ARCH__)\\n\\nkern<<<1,1>>>(1); ∕∕ error: \"kern<int>\" instantiation only\\n∕∕ when __CUDA_ARCH__ is undefined!\\n\\n#endif\\n}\\n\\nint main(void)\\n{\\nfoo();\\ncudaDeviceSynchronize();\\nreturn 0;\\n\\n}\\n\\n3. In separate compilation mode, the presence or absence of a definition of a function or variable\\nwith external linkage shall not depend on whether __CUDA_ARCH__ is defined or on a particular\\nvalue of __CUDA_ARCH__Page 303, 19.\\n\\nExample:\\n\\n#if !defined(__CUDA_ARCH__)\\nvoid foo(void) { } ∕∕ error: The definition of foo()\\n\\n∕∕ is only present when __CUDA_ARCH__\\n∕∕ is undefined\\n\\n#endif\\n\\n4. In separate compilation, __CUDA_ARCH__ must not be used in headers such that different ob-\\njects could contain different behavior. Or, it must be guaranteed that all objects will compile for\\nthe same compute_arch. If a weak function or template function is defined in a header and its\\nbehavior depends on __CUDA_ARCH__, then the instances of that function in the objects could\\nconflict if the objects are compiled for different compute arch.\\n\\nFor example, if an a.h contains:\\n\\ntemplate<typename T>\\n__device__ T* getptr(void)\\n{\\n#if __CUDA_ARCH__ == 700\\n\\nreturn NULL; ∕* no address *∕\\n#else\\n\\n__shared__ T arr[256];\\nreturn arr;\\n\\n#endif\\n}\\n\\nThen if a.cu and b.cu both include a.h and instantiate getptr for the same type, and b.cu\\nexpects a non-NULL address, and compile with:\\n\\n390 Chapter 17. C++ Language Support\\n\\n\\n\\nCUDA C++ Programming Guide, Release 12.4\\n\\nnvcc –arch=compute_70 –dc a.cu\\nnvcc –arch=compute_80 –dc b.cu\\nnvcc –arch=sm_80 a.o b.o\\n\\nAt link time only one version of the getptr is used, so the behavior would depend on which\\nversion is chosen. To avoid this, either a.cu and b.cu must be compiled for the same compute\\narch, or __CUDA_ARCH__ should not be used in the shared header function.\\n\\nThe compiler does not guarantee that a diagnostic will be generated for the unsupported uses of\\n__CUDA_ARCH__ described above.\\n\\n17.5.3. Qualifiers\\n\\n17.5.3.1 Device Memory Space Specifiers\\n\\nThe __device__, __shared__, __managed__ and __constant__ memory space specifiers are not\\nallowed on:\\n\\n▶ class, struct, and union data members,\\n\\n▶ formal parameters,\\n\\n▶ non-extern variable declarations within a function that executes on the host.\\n\\nThe __device__, __constant__ and __managed__memory space specifiers are not allowed on vari-\\nable declarations that are neither extern nor static within a function that executes on the device.\\n\\nA __device__, __constant__, __managed__ or __shared__ variable definition cannot have a class\\ntype with a non-empty constructor or a non-empty destructor. A constructor for a class type is con-\\nsidered empty at a point in the translation unit, if it is either a trivial constructor or it satisfies all of\\nthe following conditions:\\n\\n▶ The constructor function has been defined.\\n\\n▶ The constructor function has no parameters, the initializer list is empty and the function body is\\nan empty compound statement.\\n\\n▶ Its class has no virtual functions, no virtual base classes and no non-static data member initial-\\nizers.\\n\\n▶ The default constructors of all base classes of its class can be considered empty.\\n\\n▶ For all the nonstatic datamembers of its class that are of class type (or array thereof), the default\\nconstructors can be considered empty.\\n\\nA destructor for a class is considered empty at a point in the translation unit, if it is either a trivial\\ndestructor or it satisfies all of the following conditions:\\n\\n▶ The destructor function has been defined.\\n\\n▶ The destructor function body is an empty compound statement.\\n\\n▶ Its class has no virtual functions and no virtual base classes.\\n\\n▶ The destructors of all base classes of its class can be considered empty.\\n\\n▶ For all the nonstatic data members of its class that are of class type (or array thereof), the de-\\nstructor can be considered empty.\\n\\n17.5. Restrictions 391\\n\\n\\n\\nCUDA C++ Programming Guide, Release 12.4\\n\\nWhen compiling in the whole program compilationmode (see the nvcc usermanual for a description of\\nthismode), __device__, __shared__, __managed__ and __constant__ variables cannot be defined\\nas external using the extern keyword. The only exception is for dynamically allocated __shared__\\nvariables as described in index.html#__shared__.\\n\\nWhen compiling in the separate compilation mode (see the nvcc user manual for a description of this\\nmode), __device__, __shared__, __managed__ and __constant__ variables can be defined as ex-\\nternal using the extern keyword. nvlink will generate an error when it cannot find a definition for\\nan external variable (unless it is a dynamically allocated __shared__ variable).\\n\\n17.5.3.2 __managed__ Memory Space Specifier\\n\\nVariables marked with the __managed__memory space specifier (“managed” variables) have the fol-\\nlowing restrictions:\\n\\n▶ The address of a managed variable is not a constant expression.\\n\\n▶ A managed variable shall not have a const qualified type.\\n\\n▶ A managed variable shall not have a reference type.\\n\\n▶ The address or value of a managed variable shall not be used when the CUDA runtime may not\\nbe in a valid state, including the following cases:\\n\\n▶ In static/dynamic initialization or destruction of an object with static or thread local storage\\nduration.\\n\\n▶ In code that executes after exit() has been called (for example, a function marked with gcc’s\\n“__attribute__((destructor))”).\\n\\n▶ In code that executes when CUDA runtime may not be initialized (for example, a function\\nmarked with gcc’s “__attribute__((constructor))”).\\n\\n▶ A managed variable cannot be used as an unparenthesized id-expression argument to a de-\\ncltype() expression.\\n\\n▶ Managed variables have the same coherence and consistency behavior as specified for dynami-\\ncally allocated managed memory.\\n\\n▶ When a CUDA program containing managed variables is run on an execution platform with mul-\\ntiple GPUs, the variables are allocated only once, and not per GPU.\\n\\n▶ A managed variable declaration without the extern linkage is not allowed within a function that\\nexecutes on the host.\\n\\n▶ A managed variable declaration without the extern or static linkage is not allowed within a func-\\ntion that executes on the device.\\n\\nHere are examples of legal and illegal uses of managed variables:\\n\\n__device__ __managed__ int xxx = 10; ∕∕ OK\\n\\nint *ptr = &xxx; ∕∕ error: use of managed variable\\n∕∕ (xxx) in static initialization\\n\\nstruct S1_t {\\nint field;\\nS1_t(void) : field(xxx) { };\\n\\n};\\nstruct S2_t {\\n\\n~S2_t(void) { xxx = 10; }\\n(continues on next page)\\n\\n392 Chapter 17.

Extended Lambda Restrictions\\n\\nThe CUDA compiler will replace an extended lambda expression with an instance of a placeholder type\\ndefined in namespace scope, before invoking the host compiler. The template argument of the place-\\nholder type requires taking the address of a function enclosing the original extended lambda expres-\\nsion. This is required for the correct execution of any __global__ function template whose template\\nargument involves the closure type of an extended lambda. The enclosing function is computed as\\nfollows.\\n\\nBy definition, the extended lambda is present within the immediate or nested block scope of a\\n__host__ or __host__ __device__ function. If this function is not the operator() of a lambda\\nexpression, then it is considered the enclosing function for the extended lambda. Otherwise, the ex-\\ntended lambda is defined within the immediate or nested block scope of the operator() of one or\\nmore enclosing lambda expressions. If the outermost such lambda expression is defined in the im-\\nmediate or nested block scope of a function F, then F is the computed enclosing function, else the\\nenclosing function does not exist.\\n\\nExample:\\n\\nvoid foo(void) {\\n∕∕ enclosing function for lam1 is \"foo\"\\nauto lam1 = [] __device__ { };\\n\\nauto lam2 = [] {\\nauto lam3 = [] {\\n\\n∕∕ enclosing function for lam4 is \"foo\"\\nauto lam4 = [] __host__ __device__ { };\\n\\n};\\n};\\n\\n}\\n\\nauto lam6 = [] {\\n∕∕ enclosing function for lam7 does not exist\\nauto lam7 = [] __host__ __device__ { };\\n\\n};\\n\\nHere are the restrictions on extended lambdas:\\n\\n1. An extended lambda cannot be defined inside another extended lambda expression.\\n\\nExample:\\n\\nvoid foo(void) {\\nauto lam1 = [] __host__ __device__ {\\n\\n∕∕ error: extended lambda defined within another extended lambda\\nauto lam2 = [] __host__ __device__ { };\\n\\n(continues on next page)\\n\\n17.7.

The enclosing function for the extended lambda must be named and its address can be taken. If\\nthe enclosing function is a class member, then the following conditions must be satisfied:\\n\\n▶ All classes enclosing the member function must have a name.\\n\\n▶ The member function must not have private or protected access within its parent class.\\n\\n▶ All enclosing classes must not have private or protected access within their respective par-\\nent classes.\\n\\nExample:\\n\\nvoid foo(void) {\\n∕∕ OK\\nauto lam1 = [] __device__ { return 0; };\\n{\\n\\n∕∕ OK\\nauto lam2 = [] __device__ { return 0; };\\n∕∕ OK\\nauto lam3 = [] __device__ __host__ { return 0; };\\n\\n}\\n}\\n\\nstruct S1_t {\\nS1_t(void) {\\n\\n∕∕ Error: cannot take address of enclosing function\\nauto lam4 = [] __device__ { return 0; };\\n\\n}\\n};\\n\\nclass C0_t {\\nvoid foo(void) {\\n\\n(continues on next page)\\n\\n424 Chapter 17.

It must be possible to take the address of the enclosing routine unambiguously, at the point\\nwhere the extended lambda has been defined.

When parsing a function, the CUDA compiler assigns a counter value to each extended lambda\\nwithin that function. This counter value is used in the substituted named type passed to the\\nhost compiler.

As described above, the CUDA compiler replaces a __device__ extended lambda defined\\nin a host function with a placeholder type defined in namespace scope. Unless the trait\\n__nv_is_extended_device_lambda_with_preserved_return_type() returns true for the\\nclosure type of the extended lambda, the placeholder type does not define a operator() func-\\ntion equivalent to the original lambda declaration. An attempt to determine the return type or\\nparameter types of the operator() function of such a lambda may therefore work incorrectly\\nin host code, as the code processed by the host compiler will be semantically different than the\\ninput code processed by the CUDA compiler. However, it is OK to introspect the return type or\\nparameter types of the operator() function within device code. Note that this restriction does\\nnot apply to __host__ __device__ extended lambdas, or to __device__ extended lambdas\\nfor which the trait __nv_is_extended_device_lambda_with_preserved_return_type()\\nreturns true.\\n\\nExample\\n\\n#include <type_traits>\\nconst char& getRef(const char* p) { return *p; }\\n\\nvoid foo(void) {\\nauto lam1 = [] __device__ { return \"10\"; };\\n\\n∕∕ Error: attempt to extract the return type\\n∕∕ of a __device__ lambda in host code\\nstd::result_of<decltype(lam1)()>::type xx1 = \"abc\";\\n\\nauto lam2 = [] __host__ __device__ { return \"10\"; };\\n\\n∕∕ OK : lam2 represents a __host__ __device__ extended lambda\\nstd::result_of<decltype(lam2)()>::type xx2 = \"abc\";\\n\\nauto lam3 = [] __device__ () -> const char * { return \"10\"; };\\n\\n∕∕ OK : lam3 represents a __device__ extended lambda with preserved return type\\nstd::result_of<decltype(lam3)()>::type xx2 = \"abc\";\\nstatic_assert( std::is_same_v< std::result_of<decltype(lam3)()>::type, const�\\n\\n↪→char *>);\\n\\nauto lam4 = [] __device__ (char x) -> decltype(getRef(&x)) { return 0; };\\n∕∕ lam4\\'s return type is not preserved because it references the operator()\\'s\\n∕∕ parameter types in the trailing return type.\\nstatic_assert( ! __nv_is_extended_device_lambda_with_preserved_return_\\n\\n↪→type(decltype(lam4)), \"\" );\\n}\\n\\n15.

The following type traits are affected: std::is_trivially_copyable,\\nstd::is_trivially_constructible, std::is_trivially_copy_constructible,\\nstd::is_trivially_move_constructible, std::is_trivially_destructible.\\n\\nCare must be taken that the results of these type traits are not used in __global__ function\\ntemplate instantiation or in __device__ ∕ __constant__ ∕ __managed__ variable template\\ninstantiation.\\n\\nExample\\n\\ntemplate <bool b>\\nvoid __global__ foo() { printf(\"hi\"); }\\n\\ntemplate <typename T>\\nvoid dolaunch() {\\n\\n∕∕ ERROR: this kernel launch may fail, because CUDA frontend compiler\\n∕∕ and host compiler may disagree on the result of\\n∕∕ std::is_trivially_copyable() trait on the closure type of the\\n∕∕ extended lambda\\nfoo<std::is_trivially_copyable<T>::value><<<1,1>>>();\\ncudaDeviceSynchronize();\\n}\\n\\nint main() {\\nint x = 0;\\nauto lam1 = [=] __host__ __device__ () { return x; };\\ndolaunch<decltype(lam1)>();\\n}\\n\\nThe CUDA compiler will generate compiler diagnostics for a subset of cases described in 1-12; no\\ndiagnostic will be generated for cases 13-17, but the host compiler may fail to compile the generated\\ncode.\\n\\n17.7.3. Notes on __host__ __device__ lambdas\\n\\nUnlike __device__ lambdas, __host__ __device__ lambdas can be called from host code. As de-\\nscribed earlier, the CUDA compiler replaces an extended lambda expression defined in host code with\\nan instance of a named placeholder type. The placeholder type for an extended __host__ __de-\\nvice__ lambda invokes the original lambda’s operator() with an indirect function callPage 422, 35.\\n\\nThe presence of the indirect function call may cause an extended __host__ __device__ lambda to\\nbe less optimized by the host compiler than lambdas that are implicitly or explicitly __host__ only. In\\nthe latter case, the host compiler can easily inline the body of the lambda into the calling context. But\\n\\n432 Chapter 17. C++ Language Support\\n\\n\\n\\nCUDA C++ Programming Guide, Release 12.4\\n\\nin case of an extended __host__ __device__ lambda, the host compiler encounters the indirect\\nfunction call and may not be able to easily inline the original __host__ __device__ lambda body.\\n\\n17.7.4. *this Capture By Value\\n\\nWhen a lambda is defined within a non-static class member function, and the body of the lambda\\nrefers to a class member variable, C++11/C++14 rules require that the this pointer of the class is\\ncaptured by value, instead of the referenced member variable. If the lambda is an extended __de-\\nvice__ or __host____device__ lambda defined in a host function, and the lambda is executed on\\nthe GPU, accessing the referenced member variable on the GPU will cause a run time error if the this\\npointer points to host memory.\\n\\nExample:\\n\\n#include <cstdio>\\n\\ntemplate <typename T>\\n__global__ void foo(T in) { printf(\"\\\\n value = %d\", in()); }\\n\\nstruct S1_t {\\nint xxx;\\n__host__ __device__ S1_t(void) : xxx(10) { };\\n\\nvoid doit(void) {\\n\\nauto lam1 = [=] __device__ {\\n∕∕ reference to \"xxx\" causes\\n∕∕ the \\'this\\' pointer (S1_t*) to be captured by value\\nreturn xxx + 1;\\n\\n};\\n\\n∕∕ Kernel launch fails at run time because \\'this->xxx\\'\\n∕∕ is not accessible from the GPU\\nfoo<<<1,1>>>(lam1);\\ncudaDeviceSynchronize();\\n\\n}\\n};\\n\\nint main(void) {\\nS1_t s1;\\ns1.doit();\\n\\n}\\n\\nC++17 solves this problem by adding a new “*this” capture mode. In this mode, the compiler makes a\\ncopy of the object denoted by “*this” instead of capturing the pointer this by value. The “*this” cap-\\nture mode is described in more detail here: http:∕∕www.open-std.org∕jtc1∕sc22∕wg21∕docs∕\\npapers∕2016∕p0018r3.html .\\n\\nThe CUDA compiler supports the “*this” capture mode for lambdas defined within __device__\\nand __global__ functions and for extended __device__ lambdas defined in host code, when the\\n--extended-lambda nvcc flag is used.\\n\\nHere’s the above example modified to use “*this” capture mode:\\n\\n17.7.

Additional Notes\\n\\n1. ADL Lookup: As described earlier, the CUDA compiler will replace an extended lambda expression\\nwith an instance of a placeholder type, before invoking the host compiler. One template argu-\\nment of the placeholder type uses the address of the function enclosing the original lambda\\nexpression. This may cause additional namespaces to participate in argument dependent lookup\\n(ADL), for any host function call whose argument types involve the closure type of the extended\\nlambda expression. This may cause an incorrect function to be selected by the host compiler.\\n\\nExample:\\n\\nnamespace N1 {\\nstruct S1_t { };\\ntemplate <typename T> void foo(T);\\n\\n};\\n\\nnamespace N2 {\\ntemplate <typename T> int foo(T);\\n\\ntemplate <typename T> void doit(T in) { foo(in); }\\n}\\n\\nvoid bar(N1::S1_t in) {\\n∕* extended __device__ lambda. In the code sent to the host compiler, this\\n\\nis replaced with the placeholder type instantiation expression\\n\\' __nv_dl_wrapper_t< __nv_dl_tag<void (*)(N1::S1_t in),(&bar),1> > { }\\'\\n\\nAs a result, the namespace \\'N1\\' participates in ADL lookup of the\\ncall to \"foo\" in the body of N2::doit, causing ambiguity.\\n\\n*∕\\nauto lam1 = [=] __device__ { };\\nN2::doit(lam1);\\n\\n}\\n\\nIn the example above, the CUDA compiler replaced the extended lambda with a placeholder type\\n\\n17.7.

As a result, the namespace N1 participates in the ADL lookup\\nfor foo(in) in the body of N2::doit, and host compilation fails because multiple overload can-\\ndidates N1::foo and N2::foo are found.\\n\\n17.8.

These features target acceleration of specialized\\noperations which are not intended for all classes of compute capabilities (denoted by the compute\\ncapability’s minor number) or are likely to significantly change on future generations (denoted by the\\ncompute capability’s major number).\\n\\nThere are potentially two sets of compute features for a given compute capability:\\n\\nCompute Capability #.#: The predominant set of compute features that are introduced with the in-\\ntent to be available for subsequent compute architectures.

For the same reason, while SNaN encod-\\nings are supported, they are not signaling and are handled as quiet.\\n\\n▶ The result of a single-precision floating-point operation involving one or more input NaNs is the\\nquiet NaN of bit pattern 0x7fffffff.\\n\\n▶ Double-precision floating-point absolute value and negation are not compliant with IEEE-754\\nwith respect to NaNs; these are passed through unchanged.\\n\\nCode must be compiled with -ftz=false, -prec-div=true, and -prec-sqrt=true to ensure IEEE\\ncompliance (this is the default setting; see the nvcc user manual for description of these compilation\\nflags).\\n\\nRegardless of the setting of the compiler flag -ftz,\\n\\n▶ atomic single-precision floating-point adds on global memory always operate in flush-to-zero\\nmode, i.e., behave equivalent to FADD.F32.FTZ.RN,\\n\\n▶ atomic single-precision floating-point adds on shared memory always operate with denormal\\nsupport, i.e., behave equivalent to FADD.F32.RN.\\n\\nIn accordance to the IEEE-754R standard, if one of the input parameters to fminf(), fmin(),\\nfmaxf(), or fmax() is NaN, but not the other, the result is the non-NaN parameter.\\n\\nThe conversion of a floating-point value to an integer value in the case where the floating-point value\\nfalls outside the range of the integer format is left undefined by IEEE-754. For compute devices, the\\nbehavior is to clamp to the end of the supported range. This is unlike the x86 architecture behavior.\\n\\nThe behavior of integer division by zero and integer overflow is left undefinedby IEEE-754.

Applications may query the L2 cache size by checking the\\nl2CacheSize device property (see Device Enumeration).\\n\\nThe cache behavior (e.g., whether reads are cached in both the unified L1/texture cache and L2 or in\\nL2 only) can be partially configured on a per-access basis using modifiers to the load instruction.\\n\\n19.4.2. Global Memory\\n\\nGlobal memory accesses are always cached in L2.\\n\\nData that is read-only for the entire lifetime of the kernel can also be cached in the unified L1/texture\\ncache described in the previous section by reading it using the __ldg() function (see Read-Only Data\\nCache Load Function). When the compiler detects that the read-only condition is satisfied for some\\ndata, it will use __ldg() to read it. The compiler might not always be able to detect that the read-\\nonly condition is satisfied for some data. Marking pointers used for loading such data with both the\\nconst and __restrict__ qualifiers increases the likelihood that the compiler will detect the read-\\nonly condition.\\n\\nData that is not read-only for the entire lifetime of the kernel cannot be cached in the unified\\nL1/texture cache for devices of compute capability 5.0. For devices of compute capability 5.2, it is,\\nby default, not cached in the unified L1/texture cache, but cachingmay be enabled using the following\\nmechanisms:\\n\\n▶ Perform the read using inline assembly with the appropriate modifier as described in the PTX\\nreference manual;\\n\\n▶ Compile with the -Xptxas -dlcm=ca compilation flag, in which case all reads are cached, except\\nreads that are performed using inline assembly with a modifier that disables caching;\\n\\n▶ Compile with the -Xptxas -fscm=ca compilation flag, in which case all reads are cached, in-\\ncluding reads that are performed using inline assembly regardless of the modifier used.\\n\\nWhen caching is enabled using one of the three mechanisms listed above, devices of compute capa-\\nbility 5.2 will cache global memory reads in the unified L1/texture cache for all kernel launches except\\nfor the kernel launches for which thread blocks consume too much of the SM’s register file.

Independent Thread Scheduling\\n\\nThe Volta architecture introduces Independent Thread Scheduling among threads in a warp, enabling\\nintra-warp synchronization patterns previously unavailable and simplifying code changeswhen porting\\nCPU code. However, this can lead to a rather different set of threads participating in the executed\\ncode than intended if the developermade assumptions aboutwarp-synchronicity of previous hardware\\narchitectures.\\n\\nBelow are code patterns of concern and suggested corrective actions for Volta-safe code.\\n\\n1. For applications using warp intrinsics (__shfl*, __any, __all, __ballot), it is necessary that\\ndevelopers port their code to the new, safe, synchronizing counterpart, with the *_sync suffix.\\nThe new warp intrinsics take in a mask of threads that explicitly define which lanes (threads of a\\nwarp)must participate in thewarp intrinsic. SeeWarpVote Functions andWarpShuffleFunctions\\nfor details.\\n\\nSince the intrinsics are available with CUDA 9.0+, (if necessary) code can be executed conditionally\\nwith the following preprocessor macro:\\n\\n#if defined(CUDART_VERSION) && CUDART_VERSION >= 9000\\n∕∕ *_sync intrinsic\\n#endif\\n\\nThese intrinsics are available on all architectures, not just Volta or Turing, and in most cases a single\\ncode-base will suffice for all architectures. Note, however, that for Pascal and earlier architectures, all\\nthreads in mask must execute the same warp intrinsic instruction in convergence, and the union of all\\nvalues in mask must be equal to the warp’s active mask. The following code pattern is valid on Volta,\\nbut not on Pascal or earlier architectures.\\n\\nif (tid % warpSize < 16) {\\n...\\nfloat swapped = __shfl_xor_sync(0xffffffff, val, 16);\\n...\\n\\n} else {\\n...\\nfloat swapped = __shfl_xor_sync(0xffffffff, val, 16);\\n...\\n\\n}\\n\\nThe replacement for __ballot(1) is __activemask(). Note that threads within a warp can diverge\\neven within a single code path. As a result, __activemask() and __ballot(1) may return only a\\nsubset of the threads on the current code path. The following invalid code example sets bit i of\\noutput to 1 when data[i] is greater than threshold. __activemask() is used in an attempt to\\nenable cases where dataLen is not a multiple of 32.\\n\\n∕∕ Sets bit in output[] to 1 if the correspond element in data[i]\\n∕∕ is greater than \\'threshold\\', using 32 threads in a warp.\\n\\nfor (int i = warpLane; i < dataLen; i += warpSize) {\\nunsigned active = __activemask();\\nunsigned bitPack = __ballot_sync(active, data[i] > threshold);\\nif (warpLane == 0) {\\n\\noutput[i ∕ 32] = bitPack;\\n}\\n\\n}\\n\\nThis code is invalid because CUDA does not guarantee that the warp will diverge ONLY at the loop\\n\\n458 Chapter 19. Compute Capabilities\\n\\nindex.html#warp-vote-functions\\nindex.html#warp-shuffle-functions\\n\\n\\nCUDA C++ Programming Guide, Release 12.4\\n\\ncondition. When divergence happens for other reasons, conflicting results will be computed for the\\nsame 32-bit output element by different subsets of threads in the warp. A correct code might use a\\nnon-divergent loop condition together with __ballot_sync() to safely enumerate the set of threads\\nin the warp participating in the threshold calculation as follows.\\n\\nfor (int i = warpLane; i - warpLane < dataLen; i += warpSize) {\\nunsigned active = __ballot_sync(0xFFFFFFFF, i < dataLen);\\nif (i < dataLen) {\\n\\nunsigned bitPack = __ballot_sync(active, data[i] > threshold);\\nif (warpLane == 0) {\\n\\noutput[i ∕ 32] = bitPack;\\n}\\n\\n}\\n}\\n\\nDiscovery Pattern demonstrates a valid use case for __activemask().\\n\\n1. If applications have warp-synchronous codes, they will need to insert the new __syncwarp()\\nwarp-wide barrier synchronization instruction between any steps where data is exchanged be-\\ntween threads via global or shared memory. Assumptions that code is executed in lockstep or\\nthat reads/writes from separate threads are visible across a warp without synchronization are\\ninvalid.\\n\\n__shared__ float s_buff[BLOCK_SIZE];\\ns_buff[tid] = val;\\n__syncthreads();\\n\\n∕∕ Inter-warp reduction\\nfor (int i = BLOCK_SIZE ∕ 2; i >= 32; i ∕= 2) {\\n\\nif (tid < i) {\\ns_buff[tid] += s_buff[tid+i];\\n\\n}\\n__syncthreads();\\n\\n}\\n\\n∕∕ Intra-warp reduction\\n∕∕ Butterfly reduction simplifies syncwarp mask\\nif (tid < 32) {\\n\\nfloat temp;\\ntemp = s_buff[tid ^ 16]; __syncwarp();\\ns_buff[tid] += temp; __syncwarp();\\ntemp = s_buff[tid ^ 8]; __syncwarp();\\ns_buff[tid] += temp; __syncwarp();\\ntemp = s_buff[tid ^ 4]; __syncwarp();\\ns_buff[tid] += temp; __syncwarp();\\ntemp = s_buff[tid ^ 2]; __syncwarp();\\ns_buff[tid] += temp; __syncwarp();\\n\\n}\\n\\nif (tid == 0) {\\n*output = s_buff[0] + s_buff[1];\\n\\n}\\n__syncthreads();\\n\\n2. Although __syncthreads() has been consistently documented as synchronizing all threads in\\nthe thread block, Pascal and prior architectures could only enforce synchronization at the warp\\nlevel. In certain cases, this allowed a barrier to succeed without being executed by every thread\\nas long as at least some thread in every warp reached the barrier.

For the Volta architecture (compute capability 7.0), the unified data cache has a size of 128 KB,\\nand the shared memory capacity can be set to 0, 8, 16, 32, 64 or 96 KB. For the Turing architecture\\n(compute capability 7.5), the unified data cache has a size of 96 KB, and the shared memory capacity\\ncan be set to either 32 KB or 64 KB. Unlike Kepler, the driver automatically configures the shared\\nmemory capacity for each kernel to avoid shared memory occupancy bottlenecks while also allowing\\nconcurrent execution with already launched kernels where possible. In most cases, the driver’s default\\nbehavior should provide optimal performance.\\n\\nBecause the driver is not always aware of the full workload, it is sometimes useful for applications\\nto provide additional hints regarding the desired shared memory configuration. For example, a kernel\\nwith little or no shared memory use may request a larger carveout in order to encourage concurrent\\nexecution with later kernels that require more shared memory. The new cudaFuncSetAttribute()\\nAPI allows applications to set a preferred shared memory capacity, or carveout, as a percentage of\\nthe maximum supported shared memory capacity (96 KB for Volta, and 64 KB for Turing).\\n\\ncudaFuncSetAttribute() relaxes enforcement of the preferred shared capacity compared to the\\nlegacy cudaFuncSetCacheConfig()API introducedwith Kepler. The legacy API treated sharedmem-\\nory capacities as hard requirements for kernel launch. As a result, interleaving kernels with different\\nshared memory configurations would needlessly serialize launches behind shared memory reconfigu-\\nrations. With the new API, the carveout is treated as a hint. The driver may choose a different config-\\nuration if required to execute the function or to avoid thrashing.\\n\\n∕∕ Device code\\n__global__ void MyKernel(...)\\n{\\n\\n__shared__ float buffer[BLOCK_DIM];\\n...\\n\\n}\\n\\n∕∕ Host code\\nint carveout = 50; ∕∕ prefer shared memory capacity 50% of maximum\\n∕∕ Named Carveout Values:\\n∕∕ carveout = cudaSharedmemCarveoutDefault; ∕∕ (-1)\\n∕∕ carveout = cudaSharedmemCarveoutMaxL1; ∕∕ (0)\\n\\n(continues on next page)\\n\\n460 Chapter 19.

Driver API\\n\\nThis section assumes knowledge of the concepts described in CUDA Runtime.\\n\\nThe driver API is implemented in the cuda dynamic library (cuda.dll or cuda.so) which is copied on\\nthe system during the installation of the device driver.

A\\nCUDA context must then be created that is attached to a specific device and made current to the\\ncalling host thread as detailed in Context.\\n\\nWithin a CUDA context, kernels are explicitly loaded as PTX or binary objects by the host code as\\n\\n465\\n\\nindex.html#cuda-c-runtime\\nindex.html#driver-api-objects-available-in-cuda-driver-api\\nindex.html#context\\n\\n\\nCUDA C++ Programming Guide, Release 12.4\\n\\ndescribed in Module. Kernels written in C++ must therefore be compiled separately into PTX or binary\\nobjects.

Context\\n\\nA CUDA context is analogous to a CPU process. All resources and actions performed within the driver\\nAPI are encapsulated inside a CUDA context, and the system automatically cleans up these resources\\nwhen the context is destroyed. Besides objects such as modules and texture or surface references,\\neach context has its own distinct address space. As a result, CUdeviceptr values from different\\ncontexts reference different memory locations.\\n\\nA host thread may have only one device context current at a time. When a context is created with\\ncuCtxCreate(), it is made current to the calling host thread. CUDA functions that operate in a\\ncontext (most functions that do not involve device enumeration or context management) will return\\nCUDA_ERROR_INVALID_CONTEXT if a valid context is not current to the thread.\\n\\nEach host thread has a stack of current contexts. cuCtxCreate() pushes the new context onto the\\ntop of the stack. cuCtxPopCurrent() may be called to detach the context from the host thread.\\nThe context is then “floating” and may be pushed as the current context for any host thread. cuCtx-\\nPopCurrent() also restores the previous current context, if any.\\n\\nA usage count is also maintained for each context. cuCtxCreate() creates a context with a usage\\ncount of 1. cuCtxAttach() increments the usage count and cuCtxDetach() decrements it. A con-\\ntext is destroyed when the usage count goes to 0 when calling cuCtxDetach() or cuCtxDestroy().\\n\\nThe driver API is interoperable with the runtime and it is possible to access the primary context (see\\nInitialization) managed by the runtime from the driver API via cuDevicePrimaryCtxRetain().\\n\\nUsage count facilitates interoperability between third party authored code operating in the same con-\\ntext. For example, if three libraries are loaded to use the same context, each library would call cuC-\\ntxAttach() to increment the usage count and cuCtxDetach() to decrement the usage count when\\nthe library is done using the context. For most libraries, it is expected that the application will have\\ncreated a context before loading or initializing the library; that way, the application can create the con-\\ntext using its own heuristics, and the library simply operates on the context handed to it. Libraries that\\nwish to create their own contexts - unbeknownst to their API clients whomay or may not have created\\ncontexts of their own - would use cuCtxPushCurrent() and cuCtxPopCurrent() as illustrated in\\nthe following figure.\\n\\n20.1.

Driver Entry Point Access\\n\\n20.5.1. Introduction\\n\\nThe Driver Entry Point Access APIs provide a way to retrieve the address of a CUDA driver func-\\ntion. Starting from CUDA 11.3, users can call into available CUDA driver APIs using function pointers\\nobtained from these APIs.\\n\\nThese APIs provide functionality similar to their counterparts, dlsym on POSIX platforms and GetPro-\\ncAddress on Windows. The provided APIs will let users:\\n\\n▶ Retrieve the address of a driver function using the CUDA Driver API.\\n\\n20.4.

For more details, see Re-\\ntrieve per-thread default stream versions\\n\\n▶ Access new CUDA features on older toolkits but with a newer driver.\\n\\n20.5.2. Driver Function Typedefs\\n\\nTo help retrieve the CUDA Driver API entry points, the CUDA Toolkit provides access to headers con-\\ntaining the function pointer definitions for all CUDA driver APIs. These headers are installed with the\\nCUDA Toolkit and are made available in the toolkit’s include∕ directory. The table below summarizes\\nthe header files containing the typedefs for each CUDA API header file.\\n\\nTable 23: Typedefs header files for CUDA driver APIs\\n\\nAPI header file API Typedef header file\\n\\ncuda.h cudaTypedefs.h\\n\\ncudaGL.h cudaGLTypedefs.h\\n\\ncudaProfiler.h cudaProfilerTypedefs.h\\n\\ncudaVDPAU.h cudaVDPAUTypedefs.h\\n\\ncudaEGL.h cudaEGLTypedefs.h\\n\\ncudaD3D9.h cudaD3D9Typedefs.h\\n\\ncudaD3D10.h cudaD3D10Typedefs.h\\n\\ncudaD3D11.h cudaD3D11Typedefs.h\\n\\nThe above headers do not define actual function pointers themselves; they define the typedefs for\\nfunction pointers. For example, cudaTypedefs.h has the below typedefs for the driver API cuMemAl-\\nloc:\\n\\ntypedef CUresult (CUDAAPI *PFN_cuMemAlloc_v3020)(CUdeviceptr_v2 *dptr, size_t�\\n↪→bytesize);\\ntypedef CUresult (CUDAAPI *PFN_cuMemAlloc_v2000)(CUdeviceptr_v1 *dptr, unsigned int�\\n↪→bytesize);\\n\\nCUDA driver symbols have a version based naming scheme with a _v* extension in its name except\\nfor the first version. When the signature or the semantics of a specific CUDA driver API changes, we\\nincrement the version number of the corresponding driver symbol. In the case of the cuMemAlloc\\ndriver API, the first driver symbol name is cuMemAlloc and the next symbol name is cuMemAlloc_v2.\\nThe typedef for the first versionwhichwas introduced in CUDA 2.0 (2000) is PFN_cuMemAlloc_v2000.\\nThe typedef for the next versionwhichwas introduced in CUDA3.2 (3020) is PFN_cuMemAlloc_v3020.\\n\\nThe typedefs can be used to more easily define a function pointer of the appropriate type in code:\\n\\nPFN_cuMemAlloc_v3020 pfn_cuMemAlloc_v2;\\nPFN_cuMemAlloc_v2000 pfn_cuMemAlloc_v1;\\n\\nThe above method is preferable if users are interested in a specific version of the API. Additionally,\\nthe headers have predefined macros for the latest version of all driver symbols that were available\\n\\n472 Chapter 20.

For CUDA 11.3\\ntoolkit, cuMemAlloc_v2was the latest version and so we can also define its function pointer as below:\\n\\nPFN_cuMemAlloc pfn_cuMemAlloc;\\n\\n20.5.3. Driver Function Retrieval\\n\\nUsing the Driver Entry Point Access APIs and the appropriate typedef, we can get the function pointer\\nto any CUDA driver API.\\n\\n20.5.3.1 Using the driver API\\n\\nThe driver API requires CUDA version as an argument to get the ABI compatible version for the re-\\nquested driver symbol. CUDA Driver APIs have a per-function ABI denoted with a _v* extension. For\\nexample, consider the versions of cuStreamBeginCapture and their corresponding typedefs from\\ncudaTypedefs.h:\\n\\n∕∕ cuda.h\\nCUresult CUDAAPI cuStreamBeginCapture(CUstream hStream);\\nCUresult CUDAAPI cuStreamBeginCapture_v2(CUstream hStream, CUstreamCaptureMode mode);\\n\\n∕∕ cudaTypedefs.h\\ntypedef CUresult (CUDAAPI *PFN_cuStreamBeginCapture_v10000)(CUstream hStream);\\ntypedef CUresult (CUDAAPI *PFN_cuStreamBeginCapture_v10010)(CUstream hStream,�\\n↪→CUstreamCaptureMode mode);\\n\\nFrom the above typedefs in the code snippet, version suffixes _v10000 and _v10010 indicate that\\nthe above APIs were introduced in CUDA 10.0 and CUDA 10.1 respectively.\\n\\n#include <cudaTypedefs.h>\\n\\n∕∕ Declare the entry points for cuStreamBeginCapture\\nPFN_cuStreamBeginCapture_v10000 pfn_cuStreamBeginCapture_v1;\\nPFN_cuStreamBeginCapture_v10010 pfn_cuStreamBeginCapture_v2;\\n\\n∕∕ Get the function pointer to the cuStreamBeginCapture driver symbol\\ncuGetProcAddress(\"cuStreamBeginCapture\", &pfn_cuStreamBeginCapture_v1, 10000, CU_GET_\\n↪→PROC_ADDRESS_DEFAULT, &driverStatus);\\n∕∕ Get the function pointer to the cuStreamBeginCapture_v2 driver symbol\\ncuGetProcAddress(\"cuStreamBeginCapture\", &pfn_cuStreamBeginCapture_v2, 10010, CU_GET_\\n↪→PROC_ADDRESS_DEFAULT, &driverStatus);\\n\\nReferring to the code snippet above, to retrieve the address to the _v1 version of the driver API cuS-\\ntreamBeginCapture, the CUDA version argument should be exactly 10.0 (10000). Similarly, the CUDA\\nversion for retrieving the address to the _v2 version of the API should be 10.1 (10010). Specifying a\\nhigher CUDA version for retrieving a specific version of a driver API might not always be portable. For\\nexample, using 11030 here would still return the _v2 symbol, but if a hypothetical _v3 version is re-\\nleased in CUDA 11.3, the cuGetProcAddress API would start returning the newer _v3 symbol instead\\nwhen paired with a CUDA 11.3 driver. Since the ABI and function signatures of the _v2 and _v3 sym-\\nbols might differ, calling the _v3 function using the _v10010 typedef intended for the _v2 symbol\\nwould exhibit undefined behavior.\\n\\nTo retrieve the latest version of a driver API for a given CUDA Toolkit, we can also specify\\nCUDA_VERSION as the version argument and use the unversioned typedef to define the function\\n\\n20.5. Driver Entry Point Access 473\\n\\n\\n\\nCUDA C++ Programming Guide, Release 12.4\\n\\npointer. Since _v2 is the latest version of the driver API cuStreamBeginCapture in CUDA 11.3, the\\nbelow code snippet shows a different method to retrieve it.\\n\\n∕∕ Assuming we are using CUDA 11.3 Toolkit\\n\\n#include <cudaTypedefs.h>\\n\\n∕∕ Declare the entry point\\nPFN_cuStreamBeginCapture pfn_cuStreamBeginCapture_latest;\\n\\n∕∕ Intialize the entry point. Specifying CUDA_VERSION will give the function pointer to�\\n↪→the\\n∕∕ cuStreamBeginCapture_v2 symbol since it is latest version on CUDA 11.3.\\ncuGetProcAddress(\"cuStreamBeginCapture\", &pfn_cuStreamBeginCapture_latest, CUDA_\\n↪→VERSION, CU_GET_PROC_ADDRESS_DEFAULT, &driverStatus);\\n\\nNote that requesting a driver API with an invalid CUDA version will return an error\\nCUDA_ERROR_NOT_FOUND. In the above code examples, passing in a version less than 10000\\n(CUDA 10.0) would be invalid.\\n\\n20.5.3.2 Using the runtime API\\n\\nThe runtime API uses the CUDA runtime version to get the ABI compatible version for the requested\\ndriver symbol. In the below code snippet, theminimumCUDA runtime version required would be CUDA\\n11.2 as cuMemAllocAsync was introduced then.\\n\\n#include <cudaTypedefs.h>\\n\\n∕∕ Declare the entry point\\nPFN_cuMemAllocAsync pfn_cuMemAllocAsync;\\n\\n∕∕ Intialize the entry point. Assuming CUDA runtime version >= 11.2\\ncudaGetDriverEntryPoint(\"cuMemAllocAsync\", &pfn_cuMemAllocAsync, cudaEnableDefault, &\\n↪→driverStatus);\\n\\n∕∕ Call the entry point\\nif(driverStatus == cudaDriverEntryPointSuccess && pfn_cuMemAllocAsync) {\\n\\npfn_cuMemAllocAsync(...);\\n}\\n\\n20.5.3.3 Retrieve per-thread default stream versions\\n\\nSome CUDA driver APIs can be configured to have default stream or per-thread default stream seman-\\ntics. Driver APIs having per-thread default stream semantics are suffixed with _ptsz or _ptds in their\\nname. For example, cuLaunchKernel has a per-thread default stream variant named cuLaunchK-\\nernel_ptsz. With the Driver Entry Point Access APIs, users can request for the per-thread default\\nstream version of the driver API cuLaunchKernel instead of the default stream version. Configuring\\nthe CUDA driver APIs for default stream or per-thread default stream semantics affects the synchro-\\nnization behavior. More details can be found here.\\n\\nThe default stream or per-thread default stream versions of a driver API can be obtained by one of the\\nfollowing ways:\\n\\n▶ Use the compilation flag --default-stream per-thread or define the macro\\nCUDA_API_PER_THREAD_DEFAULT_STREAM to get per-thread default stream behavior.\\n\\n474 Chapter 20.

For discussion, let\\nus assume the user is on CUDA 11.3 and wants to use a new driver API cuFoo available in the CUDA\\n12.0 driver. The below code snippet illustrates this use-case:\\n\\nint main()\\n{\\n\\n∕∕ Assuming we have CUDA 12.0 driver installed.\\n\\n∕∕ Manually define the prototype as cudaTypedefs.h in CUDA 11.3 does not have the�\\n↪→cuFoo typedef\\n\\ntypedef CUresult (CUDAAPI *PFN_cuFoo)(...);\\nPFN_cuFoo pfn_cuFoo = NULL;\\nCUdriverProcAddressQueryResult driverStatus;\\n\\n∕∕ Get the address for cuFoo API using cuGetProcAddress.

Potential Implications with cuGetProcAddress\\n\\nBelow is a set of concrete and theoretical examples of potential issues with cuGetProcAddress and\\ncudaGetDriverEntryPoint.\\n\\n20.5. Driver Entry Point Access 475\\n\\n\\n\\nCUDA C++ Programming Guide, Release 12.4\\n\\n20.5.4.1 Implications with cuGetProcAddress vs Implicit Linking\\n\\ncuDeviceGetUuidwas introduced in CUDA9.2. This API has a newer revision (cuDeviceGetUuid_v2)\\nintroduced in CUDA 11.4. To preserve minor version compatibility, cuDeviceGetUuid will not be ver-\\nsion bumped to cuDeviceGetUuid_v2 in cuda.h until CUDA 12.0. This means that calling it by ob-\\ntaining a function pointer to it via cuGetProcAddress might have different behavior. Example using\\nthe API directly:\\n\\n#include <cuda.h>\\n\\nCUuuid uuid;\\nCUdevice dev;\\nCUresult status;\\n\\nstatus = cuDeviceGet(&dev, 0); ∕∕ Get device 0\\n∕∕ handle status\\n\\nstatus = cuDeviceGetUuid(&uuid, dev) ∕∕ Get uuid of device 0\\n\\nIn this example, assume the user is compiling with CUDA 11.4. Note that this will perform the behavior\\nof cuDeviceGetUuid, not _v2 version. Now an example of using cuGetProcAddress:\\n\\n#include <cudaTypedefs.h>\\n\\nCUuuid uuid;\\nCUdevice dev;\\nCUresult status;\\nCUdriverProcAddressQueryResult driverStatus;\\n\\nstatus = cuDeviceGet(&dev, 0); ∕∕ Get device 0\\n∕∕ handle status\\n\\nPFN_cuDeviceGetUuid pfn_cuDeviceGetUuid;\\nstatus = cuGetProcAddress(\"cuDeviceGetUuid\", &pfn_cuDeviceGetUuid, CUDA_VERSION, CU_\\n↪→GET_PROC_ADDRESS_DEFAULT, &driverStatus);\\nif(CUDA_SUCCESS == status && pfn_cuDeviceGetUuid) {\\n\\n∕∕ pfn_cuDeviceGetUuid points to ???\\n}\\n\\nIn this example, assume the user is compiling with CUDA 11.4. This will get the function pointer of\\ncuDeviceGetUuid_v2. Calling the function pointer will then invoke the new _v2 function, not the\\nsame cuDeviceGetUuid as shown in the previous example.\\n\\n20.5.4.2 Compile Time vs Runtime Version Usage in cuGetProcAddress\\n\\nLet’s take the same issue andmake one small tweak. The last example used the compile time constant\\nof CUDA_VERSION to determine which function pointer to obtain. More complications arise if the user\\nqueries the driver version dynamically using cuDriverGetVersion or cudaDriverGetVersion to\\npass to cuGetProcAddress. Example:\\n\\n#include <cudaTypedefs.h>\\n\\nCUuuid uuid;\\nCUdevice dev;\\nCUresult status;\\n\\n(continues on next page)\\n\\n476 Chapter 20. Driver API\\n\\n\\n\\nCUDA C++ Programming Guide, Release 12.4\\n\\n(continued from previous page)\\n\\nint cudaVersion;\\nCUdriverProcAddressQueryResult driverStatus;\\n\\nstatus = cuDeviceGet(&dev, 0); ∕∕ Get device 0\\n∕∕ handle status\\n\\nstatus = cuDriverGetVersion(&cudaVersion);\\n∕∕ handle status\\n\\nPFN_cuDeviceGetUuid pfn_cuDeviceGetUuid;\\nstatus = cuGetProcAddress(\"cuDeviceGetUuid\", &pfn_cuDeviceGetUuid, cudaVersion, CU_\\n↪→GET_PROC_ADDRESS_DEFAULT, &driverStatus);\\nif(CUDA_SUCCESS == status && pfn_cuDeviceGetUuid) {\\n\\n∕∕ pfn_cuDeviceGetUuid points to ???\\n}\\n\\nIn this example, assume the user is compiling with CUDA 11.3. The user would debug, test, and deploy\\nthis application with the known behavior of getting cuDeviceGetUuid (not the _v2 version). Since\\nCUDA has guaranteed ABI compatibility between minor versions, this same application is expected\\nto run after the driver is upgraded to CUDA 11.4 (without updating the toolkit and runtime) with-\\nout requiring recompilation. This will have undefined behavior though, because now the typedef for\\nPFN_cuDeviceGetUuid will still be of the signature for the original version, but since cudaVersion\\nwould now be 11040 (CUDA 11.4), cuGetProcAddress would return the function pointer to the _v2\\nversion, meaning calling it might have undefined behavior.\\n\\nNote in this case the original (not the _v2 version) typedef looks like:\\n\\ntypedef CUresult (CUDAAPI *PFN_cuDeviceGetUuid_v9020)(CUuuid *uuid, CUdevice_v1 dev);\\n\\nBut the _v2 version typedef looks like:\\n\\ntypedef CUresult (CUDAAPI *PFN_cuDeviceGetUuid_v11040)(CUuuid *uuid, CUdevice_v1 dev);\\n\\nSo in this case, the API/ABI is going to be the same and the runtime API call will likely not cause issues–\\nonly the potential for unknown uuid return. In Implications to API/ABI, we discuss a more problematic\\ncase of API/ABI compatibility.\\n\\n20.5.4.3 API Version Bumps with Explicit Version Checks\\n\\nAbove, was a specific concrete example. Now for instance let’s use a theoretical example that still has\\nissues with compatibility across driver versions. Example:\\n\\nCUresult cuFoo(int bar); ∕∕ Introduced in CUDA 11.4\\nCUresult cuFoo_v2(int bar); ∕∕ Introduced in CUDA 11.5\\nCUresult cuFoo_v3(int bar, void* jazz); ∕∕ Introduced in CUDA 11.6\\n\\ntypedef CUresult (CUDAAPI *PFN_cuFoo_v11040)(int bar);\\ntypedef CUresult (CUDAAPI *PFN_cuFoo_v11050)(int bar);\\ntypedef CUresult (CUDAAPI *PFN_cuFoo_v11060)(int bar, void* jazz);\\n\\nNotice that the API has beenmodified twice since original creation in CUDA11.4 and the latest in CUDA\\n11.6 also modified the API/ABI interface to the function. The usage in user code compiled against\\nCUDA 11.5 is:\\n\\n20.5.

The point of this ex-\\nample was to illustrate that even explicit version checks for cuGetProcAddressmay not safely cover\\nthe minor version bumps within a CUDA major release.\\n\\n20.5.4.4 Issues with Runtime API Usage\\n\\nThe above examples were focused on the issues with the Driver API usage for obtaining the func-\\ntion pointers to driver APIs. Now we will discuss the potential issues with the Runtime API usage for\\ncudaApiGetDriverEntryPoint.\\n\\nWe will start by using the Runtime APIs similar to the above.\\n\\n#include <cuda.h>\\n#include <cudaTypedefs.h>\\n#include <cuda_runtime.h>\\n\\nCUresult status;\\ncudaError_t error;\\nint driverVersion, runtimeVersion;\\nCUdriverProcAddressQueryResult driverStatus;\\n\\n∕∕ Ask the runtime for the function\\nPFN_cuDeviceGetUuid pfn_cuDeviceGetUuidRuntime;\\nerror = cudaGetDriverEntryPoint (\"cuDeviceGetUuid\", &pfn_cuDeviceGetUuidRuntime,�\\n↪→cudaEnableDefault, &driverStatus);\\nif(cudaSuccess == error && pfn_cuDeviceGetUuidRuntime) {\\n\\n∕∕ pfn_cuDeviceGetUuid points to ???\\n}\\n\\n478 Chapter 20. Driver API\\n\\n\\n\\nCUDA C++ Programming Guide, Release 12.4\\n\\nThe function pointer in this example is even more complicated than the driver only examples above\\nbecause there is no control over which version of the function to obtain; it will always get the API for\\nthe current CUDA Runtime version. See the following table for more information:\\n\\nStatic Runtime Version Linkage\\n\\nDriver Version Installed V11.3 V11.4\\n\\nV11.3 v1 v1x\\n\\nV11.4 v1 v2\\n\\nV11.3 => 11.3 CUDA Runtime and Toolkit (includes header files cuda.h and cudaTypedefs.\\n↪→h)\\nV11.4 => 11.4 CUDA Runtime and Toolkit (includes header files cuda.h and cudaTypedefs.\\n↪→h)\\nv1 => cuDeviceGetUuid\\nv2 => cuDeviceGetUuid_v2\\n\\nx => Implies the typedef function pointer won\\'t match the returned\\nfunction pointer.

So, on a system without MIG, the user might not even realize they are getting a different\\nAPI.\\n\\nMore problematic is an API which changes its application signature (and hence ABI) such as cuCtx-\\nCreate. The _v2 version, introduced in CUDA 3.2 is currently used as the default cuCtxCreate when\\nusing cuda.h but now has a newer version introduced in CUDA 11.4 (cuCtxCreate_v3). The API sig-\\nnature has been modified as well, and now takes extra arguments. So, in some of the cases above,\\nwhere the typedef to the function pointer doesn’t match the returned function pointer, there is a\\nchance for non-obvious ABI incompatibility which would lead to undefined behavior.\\n\\nFor example, assume the following code compiled against a CUDA 11.3 toolkit with a CUDA 11.4 driver\\ninstalled:\\n\\nPFN_cuCtxCreate cuUnknown;\\nCUdriverProcAddressQueryResult driverStatus;\\n\\n(continues on next page)\\n\\n480 Chapter 20.

Determining cuGetProcAddress Failure Reasons\\n\\nThere are two types of errors with cuGetProcAddress. Those are (1) API/usage errors and (2) inability to\\nfind the driver API requested. The first error type will return error codes from the API via the CUresult\\nreturn value. Things like passing NULL as the pfn variable or passing invalid flags.\\n\\nThe second error type encodes in the CUdriverProcAddressQueryResult *symbolStatus and\\ncan be used to help distinguish potential issues with the driver not being able to find the symbol\\nrequested. Take the following example:\\n\\n∕∕ cuDeviceGetExecAffinitySupport was introduced in release CUDA 11.4\\n#include <cuda.h>\\nCUdriverProcAddressQueryResult driverStatus;\\ncudaVersion = ...;\\nstatus = cuGetProcAddress(\"cuDeviceGetExecAffinitySupport\", &pfn, cudaVersion, 0, &\\n↪→driverStatus);\\nif (CUDA_SUCCESS == status) {\\n\\nif (CU_GET_PROC_ADDRESS_VERSION_NOT_SUFFICIENT == driverStatus) {\\nprintf(\"We can use the new feature when you upgrade cudaVersion to 11.4, but�\\n\\n↪→CUDA driver is good to go!\\\\n\");\\n∕∕ Indicating cudaVersion was < 11.4 but run against a CUDA driver >= 11.4\\n\\n}\\nelse if (CU_GET_PROC_ADDRESS_SYMBOL_NOT_FOUND == driverStatus) {\\n\\nprintf(\"Please update both CUDA driver and cudaVersion to at least 11.4 to�\\n↪→use the new feature!\\\\n\");\\n\\n∕∕ Indicating driver is < 11.4 since string not found, doesn\\'t matter what�\\n↪→cudaVersion was\\n\\n}\\nelse if (CU_GET_PROC_ADDRESS_SUCCESS == driverStatus && pfn) {\\n\\nprintf(\"You\\'re using cudaVersion and CUDA driver >= 11.4, using new feature!\\\\n\\n↪→\");\\n\\npfn();\\n}\\n\\n}\\n\\nThe first case with the return code CU_GET_PROC_ADDRESS_VERSION_NOT_SUFFICIENT indi-\\ncates that the symbol was found when searching in the CUDA driver but it was added later\\nthan the cudaVersion supplied. In the example, specifying cudaVersion as anything 11030\\nor less and when running against a CUDA driver >= CUDA 11.4 would give this result of\\nCU_GET_PROC_ADDRESS_VERSION_NOT_SUFFICIENT. This is because cuDeviceGetExecAffini-\\ntySupport was added in CUDA 11.4 (11040).\\n\\nThe second case with the return code CU_GET_PROC_ADDRESS_SYMBOL_NOT_FOUND indicates that\\n\\n20.5. Driver Entry Point Access 481\\n\\n\\n\\nCUDA C++ Programming Guide, Release 12.4\\n\\nthe symbol was not found when searching in the CUDA driver. This can be due to a few reasons such\\nas unsupported CUDA function due to older driver as well as just having a typo. In the latter, similar to\\nthe last example if the user had putsymbol asCUDeviceGetExecAffinitySupport - notice the capital CU\\nto start the string - cuGetProcAddress would not be able to find the API because the string doesn’t\\nmatch. In the former case an example might be the user developing an application against a CUDA\\ndriver supporting the new API, and deploying the application against an older CUDA driver. Using the\\nlast example, if the developer developed against CUDA 11.4 or later but was deployed against a CUDA\\n11.3 driver, during their development they may have had a succesful cuGetProcAddress, but when\\ndeploying an application running against a CUDA 11.3 driver the call would no longer work with the\\nCU_GET_PROC_ADDRESS_SYMBOL_NOT_FOUND returned in driverStatus.\\n\\n482 Chapter 20.

This includes\\nmemory allocated with system allocation APIs, such as malloc(), mmap(), C++ new() operator, and\\nalso automatic variables on CPU thread stacks, thread locals, global variables, and so on.\\n\\nSystem-AllocatedMemorymaybepopullated onfirst touch, depending on theAPI and systemsettings\\nused. First touch means that: - The allocation APIs allocate virtual memory and return immediately,\\nand - physical memory is populated when a thread accesses the memory for the first time.\\n\\nUsually, the physical memory will be chosen “close” to the processor that thread is running on.

In the example above, accessing x before the kernel launch triggers context\\ncreation on device 0. In the absence of that access, the kernel launch would have triggered context\\ncreation.\\n\\nC++ objects declared as __managed__ are subject to certain specific constraints, particularly where\\nstatic initializers are concerned.

Data Migration and Coherency\\n\\nUnified Memory attempts to optimize memory performance by migrating data towards the device\\nwhere it is being accessed (that is, moving data to hostmemory if the CPU is accessing it and to device\\nmemory if the GPUwill access it). Datamigration is fundamental to UnifiedMemory, but is transparent\\nto a program. The systemwill try to place data in the locationwhere it canmost efficiently be accessed\\nwithout violating coherency.\\n\\nThe physical location of data is invisible to a program andmay be changed at any time, but accesses to\\nthe data’s virtual address will remain valid and coherent from any processor regardless of locality. Note\\nthat maintaining coherence is the primary requirement, ahead of performance; within the constraints\\nof the host operating system, the system is permitted to either fail accesses or move data in order to\\nmaintain global coherence between processors.\\n\\n22.2.2. GPU Memory Oversubscription\\n\\nDevices with pageable memory access support 49-bit virtual addressing. This is large enough to cover\\nthe 48-bit virtual address spaces of modern CPUs, as well as the GPU’s own memory. The large virtual\\naddress space and page faulting capability enable applications to access the entire system virtual\\nmemory, not limited by the physical memory size of any one processor. This means that applications\\ncan oversubscribe the memory system: in other words they can allocate, access, and share arrays\\nlarger than the total physical capacity of the system, enabling out-of-core processing of very large\\ndatasets. cudaMallocManaged or system allocators will not run out of memory as long as there is\\nenough system memory available for the allocation.\\n\\n22.2.3. Multi-GPU\\n\\nManaged allocations on systems with devices of compute capability 6.x are visible to all GPUs and can\\nmigrate to any processor on-demand. Unified Memory performance hints (see Performance Tuning)\\nallow developers to explore custom usage patterns, such as read duplication of data across GPUs and\\ndirect access to peer GPU memory without migration.\\n\\n22.2.4. System Allocator\\n\\nOn hardware coherent systems with ATS, the device can directly access the host’s page tables. A\\nmiss in the GPU MMU will result in an Address Translation Request (ATR) to the CPU. The CPU looks\\nin its page tables for the virtual-to-physical mapping for that address and supplies the translation\\nback to the GPU. ATS provides the GPU full access to system memory, such as memory allocated\\nwith malloc, memory allocated on stack, global variables and file-backed memory. An application can\\nquery whether the device supports coherently accessing pageable memory via ATS by checking the\\nnew pageableMemoryAccessUsesHostPageTables property.\\n\\n22.2.

Hardware Coherency\\n\\nHardware coherent systems have the device attribute cudaDevAttrDirectManagedMemAccess-\\nFromHost set to 1. This enables hardware support for coherent reads, stores and atomic accesses\\nfrom the host on the device’s memory.

Advanced Topics\\n\\n22.2.7.1 Memcpy()/Memset() Behavior With Unified Memory\\n\\nSince unified memory can be accessed from either the host or the device, cudaMemcpy*() relies\\non the type of transfer, specified using cudaMemcpyKind, to determine whether the data should be\\naccessed as a host pointer or a device pointer.\\n\\nIn general, the source data is accessed from the host if cudaMemcpyHostTo* is specified and from\\nthe device if cudaMemcpyDeviceTo* is specified. Similar rules apply to the destination data for cu-\\ndaMemcpy*ToHost and cudaMemcpy*ToDevice respectively.\\n\\nWhen using cudaMemset*() with unified memory, the data is always accessed from the device.\\n\\n22.2.7.2 Interprocess Communication (IPC) with Unified Memory\\n\\nSee Interprocess Communication for general information about CUDA IPC.\\n\\nOn systems with pageable memory access, sharing of pointers allocated using the system allocator\\n(for example malloc) between processes is allowed. Pages of forked processes are copied-on-write,\\nresulting in independent pages for the heap as soon as one of the processes attempts to write to the\\nheap.

The Unified\\nMemory systemwill not correctly managememory handles associated with these pointers and results\\nwill be undefined if either the child or parent accesses managed data following a fork().\\n\\n22.2.8. Performance Tuning\\n\\nIn order to achieve good performance with Unified Memory, the following objectives must be met:\\n\\n▶ Faults should be avoided: While replayable faults are fundamental to enabling a simpler pro-\\ngramming model, they can be severely detrimental to application performance. Fault handling\\ncan take tens of microseconds because it may involve TLB invalidates, data migrations and page\\ntable updates. All thewhile, execution in certain portions of the applicationwill be halted, thereby\\npotentially impacting overall performance.\\n\\n▶ Data should be local to the accessing processor: As mentioned before, memory access latencies\\nand bandwidth are significantly better when the data is placed local to the processor accessing\\nit. Therefore, data should be suitably migrated to take advantage of lower latencies and higher\\nbandwidth.\\n\\n▶ Memory thrashing should be prevented: If data is frequently accessed bymultiple processors and\\nhas to be constantlymigrated around to achieve data locality, then the overhead ofmigrationmay\\nexceed the benefits of locality. Memory thrashing should be prevented to the extent possible. If\\nit cannot be prevented, it must be detected and resolved appropriately.\\n\\n22.2. Unified memory on devices with full CUDA Unified Memory support 507\\n\\n\\n\\nCUDA C++ Programming Guide, Release 12.4\\n\\n▶ Applications with a large memory footprint should minimize translation-lookaside buffer (TLB)\\ncache misses.\\n\\n▶ For systems with direct access to GPU-resident memory from the host, avoid frequent small\\nwrites to GPU-resident memory from the host.\\n\\n▶ Exploit asynchronous access to system memory by utilizing available resources in parallel if pos-\\nsible.\\n\\n▶ Consider tuning your application for the granularity of memory transfers of your system.\\n\\nTo achieve the same level of performance as what’s possible without using Unified Memory, the appli-\\ncation has to guide the Unified Memory driver subsystem into avoiding the aforementioned pitfalls. It\\nis worthy to note that the UnifiedMemory driver subsystem can detect common data access patterns\\nand achieve some of these objectives automatically without application participation. But when the\\ndata access patterns are non-obvious, explicit guidance from the application is crucial. CUDA 8.0 in-\\ntroduces useful APIs for providing the runtime with memory usage hints (cudaMemAdvise()) and for\\nexplicit prefetching (cudaMemPrefetchAsync()). These tools allow the same capabilities as explicit\\nmemory copy and pinning APIs without reverting to the limitations of explicit GPU memory allocation.\\n\\n22.2.8.1 Page Sizes\\n\\nMany of the sections for unified memory performance tuning assume prior knowledge on memory\\npages and page sizes. This section attempts to define all necessary terms and explain why page sizes\\nmatter for performance.\\n\\nAll current processors with a memory management unit (MMU), including both CPUs and GPUs, divide\\nthe addressable physical memory range into a hierarchy of chunks of different sizes: memory pages,\\ncache lines and potentially others. Memory pages are the largest of these chunks in the hierarchy at\\nthe hardware level: this means for example that a physical allocation of memory can never be smaller\\nthan the page size of the processor.\\n\\nCurrently, most CPUs inlcuding all x86_64 based architectures, are using a page size of 4KiB. ARM-\\nbased architectures may support page sizes of 4KiB, 16KiB, 32KiB and 64KiB, depending on the exact\\nCPU. Finally, all NVIDIA GPUs are using a 2MiB page size, significantly larger than the page sizes of\\nCPUs. Note that these sizes are subject to change in future hardware.\\n\\nCurrent softwarememorymanagement typically uses virtual addresses andmay define their own page\\nsizes. The default page size usually corresponds to the physical page size, but larger page sizes may\\nbe emulated, since virtual addresses must be translated into physical addresses for any access in a\\nvirtual memory system anyway.\\n\\nLarge page sizes lead to fewer misses in the caches for address translation, typically referred to as\\ntranslation lookaside buffers (TLBs). On the other hand, large page sizes may lead to higher fragmen-\\ntation in the virtual memory space, and occasional latency spikes in the applications in case a memory\\npage must be migrated from one physical memory to another.\\n\\nBecause physical pages may change in the future and software can usually emulate larger page sizes,\\napplications should generally not tune their performance to a given physical page size. However, ap-\\nplications should be aware of different page sizes, especially in unified memory systems where it can\\nbe beneficial to match the page sizes of memory resident on the CPU and GPU.\\n\\nThe Overview of memory allocators for Unified Memory includes some details on what page sizes var-\\nious allocators support. The system page size refers to the default page size of the operating system,\\nusually the page size supported by the processor for physical allocations.\\n\\nFor more details on how to ensure system-allocatedmemory uses larger page sizes to match the page\\nsize of the GPU, see Minimizing TLB cache misses.\\n\\n508 Chapter 22. Unified Memory Programming\\n\\nindex.html#um-allocators\\nindex.html#um-tlb-misses\\n\\n\\nCUDA C++ Programming Guide, Release 12.4\\n\\n22.2.8.2 Data Prefetching\\n\\nData prefetching means migrating data to a processor’s memory and potentially mapping it in that\\nprocessor’s page tables before the processor begins accessing that data. The intent of data prefetch-\\ning is to avoid faults while also establishing data locality. This is most valuable for applications that\\naccess data primarily from a single processor at any given time. As the accessing processor changes\\nduring the lifetime of the application, the data can be prefetched accordingly to follow the execution\\nflow of the application. Since work is launched in streams in CUDA, it is expected of data prefetching\\nto also be a streamed operation as shown in the following API:\\n\\ncudaError_t cudaMemPrefetchAsync(const void *devPtr,\\nsize_t count,\\nint dstDevice,\\ncudaStream_t stream);\\n\\nwhere the memory region specified by devPtr pointer and count number of bytes, with ptr rounded\\ndown to the nearest page boundary and count rounded up to the nearest page boundary, is migrated\\nto the dstDevice by enqueueing a migration operation in stream. Passing in cudaCpuDeviceId for\\ndstDevice will cause data to be migrated to CPU memory.\\n\\nConsider a simple code example below:\\n\\nSystem Allocator\\n\\nvoid test_prefetch_sam(cudaStream_t s) {\\nchar *data = (char*)malloc(N);\\ninit_data(data, N); ∕∕ execute on CPU\\ncudaMemPrefetchAsync(data, N, myGpuId, s); ∕∕ prefetch to GPU\\nmykernel<<<(N + TPB - 1) ∕ TPB, TPB, 0, s>>>(data, N); ∕∕ execute on GPU\\ncudaMemPrefetchAsync(data, N, cudaCpuDeviceId, s); ∕∕ prefetch to CPU\\ncudaStreamSynchronize(s);\\nuse_data(data, N);\\nfree(data);\\n\\n}\\n\\nManaged\\n\\nvoid test_prefetch_managed(cudaStream_t s) {\\nchar *data;\\ncudaMallocManaged(&data, N);\\ninit_data(data, N); ∕∕ execute on CPU\\ncudaMemPrefetchAsync(data, N, myGpuId, s); ∕∕ prefetch to GPU\\nmykernel<<<(N + TPB - 1) ∕ TPB, TPB, 0, s>>>(data, N); ∕∕ execute on GPU\\ncudaMemPrefetchAsync(data, N, cudaCpuDeviceId, s); ∕∕ prefetch to CPU\\ncudaStreamSynchronize(s);\\nuse_data(data, N);\\ncudaFree(data);\\n\\n}\\n\\nWithout performance hints the kernel mykernel will fault on first access to datawhich creates addi-\\ntional overhead of the fault processing and generally slows down the application. By prefetching data\\nin advance it is possible to avoid page faults and achieve better performance.\\n\\n22.2. Unified memory on devices with full CUDA Unified Memory support 509\\n\\n\\n\\nCUDA C++ Programming Guide, Release 12.4\\n\\nThis API follows stream ordering semantics, i.e. the migration does not begin until all prior operations\\nin the stream have completed, and any subsequent operation in the stream does not begin until the\\nmigration has completed.\\n\\n22.2.8.3 Data Usage Hints\\n\\nData prefetching alone is insufficient when multiple processors need to simultaneously access the\\nsame data. In such scenarios, it’s useful for the application to provide hints on how the data will\\nactually be used. The following advisory API can be used to specify data usage:\\n\\ncudaError_t cudaMemAdvise(const void *devPtr,\\nsize_t count,\\nenum cudaMemoryAdvise advice,\\nint device);\\n\\nwhere advice, specified for data contained in region starting from devPtr address and with the\\nlength of count bytes, rounded to the nearest page boundary, can take the following values:\\n\\n▶ cudaMemAdviseSetReadMostly: This implies that the data is mostly going to be read from\\nand only occasionally written to. This allows the driver to create read-only copies of the data in\\na processor’s memory when that processor accesses it. Similarly, if cudaMemPrefetchAsync is\\ncalled on this region, it will create a read-only copy of the data on the destination processor. When\\na processor writes to this data, all copies of the corresponding page are invalidated except for\\nthe one where the write occurred. The device argument is ignored for this advice. On systems\\nwith pageablememory access, note that this advice does not apply to system-allocatedmemory,\\nbut only managed memory. This advice allows multiple processors to simultaneously access the\\nsame data at maximal bandwidth as illustrated in the following code snippet:\\n\\nvoid test_advise_managed(cudaStream_t stream) {\\nchar *dataPtr;\\nsize_t dataSize = 64 * TPB; ∕∕ 16 KiB\\n∕∕ Allocate memory using malloc or cudaMallocManaged\\ncudaMallocManaged(&dataPtr, dataSize);\\n∕∕ Set the advice on the memory region\\ncudaMemAdvise(dataPtr, dataSize, cudaMemAdviseSetReadMostly, myGpuId);\\nint outerLoopIter = 0;\\nwhile (outerLoopIter < maxOuterLoopIter) {\\n\\n∕∕ The data is written to in the outer loop on the CPU\\ninit_data(dataPtr, dataSize);\\n∕∕ The data is made available to all GPUs by prefetching.\\n∕∕ Prefetching here causes read duplication of data instead\\n∕∕ of data migration\\nfor (int device = 0; device < maxDevices; device++) {\\ncudaMemPrefetchAsync(dataPtr, dataSize, device, stream);\\n\\n}\\n∕∕ The kernel only reads this data in the inner loop\\nint innerLoopIter = 0;\\nwhile (innerLoopIter < maxInnerLoopIter) {\\nmykernel<<<32, TPB, 0, stream>>>((const char *)dataPtr, dataSize);\\ninnerLoopIter++;\\n\\n}\\nouterLoopIter++;\\n\\n}\\ncudaFree(dataPtr);\\n\\n}\\n\\n510 Chapter 22. Unified Memory Programming\\n\\nindex.html#um-requirements\\nindex.html#um-requirements\\n\\n\\nCUDA C++ Programming Guide, Release 12.4\\n\\n▶ cudaMemAdviseSetPreferredLocation: This advice sets the preferred location for the data\\nto be thememory belonging to device. Passing in a value of cudaCpuDeviceId for device sets\\nthe preferred location as CPUmemory. Setting the preferred location does not cause data to mi-\\ngrate to that location immediately. Instead, it guides the migration policy when a fault occurs\\non that memory region. If the data is already in its preferred location and the faulting proces-\\nsor can establish a mapping without requiring the data to be migrated, then the migration will\\nbe avoided. On the other hand, if the data is not in its preferred location or if a direct mapping\\ncannot be established, then it will be migrated to the processor accessing it. It is important to\\nnote that setting the preferred location does not prevent data prefetching done using cudaMem-\\nPrefetchAsync.\\n\\n▶ cudaMemAdviseSetAccessedBy: This advice implies that the data will be accessed by device.\\nThis does not cause datamigration and has no impact on the location of the data per se. Instead,\\nit causes the data to always be mapped in the specified processor’s page tables, as long as the\\nlocation of the data permits a mapping to be established. If the data gets migrated for any rea-\\nson, the mappings are updated accordingly. This advice is useful in scenarios where data locality\\nis not important, but avoiding faults is. Consider for example a system containing multiple GPUs\\nwith peer-to-peer access enabled, where the data located on one GPU is occasionally accessed\\nby other GPUs. In such scenarios, migrating data over to the other GPUs is not as important\\nbecause the accesses are infrequent and the overhead of migration may be too high. But pre-\\nventing faults can still help improve performance, and so having a mapping set up in advance is\\nuseful. Note that on CPU access of this data, the data may be migrated to CPUmemory because\\nthe CPU cannot access GPU memory directly. Any GPU that had the cudaMemAdviceSetAc-\\ncessedBy flag set for this data will now have its mapping updated to point to the page in CPU\\nmemory. On hardware coherent systems, system-allocated memory is mapped by default on the\\ndevice’s page tables, but managed memory is currently not mapped by default.\\n\\nEach advice can be also unset by using one of the following values: cudaMemAdviseUnsetRead-\\nMostly, cudaMemAdviseUnsetPreferredLocation and cudaMemAdviseUnsetAccessedBy.\\n\\n22.2.8.4 Querying Usage Attributes\\n\\nA program can query memory range attributes assigned through cudaMemAdvise or cudaMem-\\nPrefetchAsync by using the following API:\\n\\ncudaMemRangeGetAttribute(void *data,\\nsize_t dataSize,\\nenum cudaMemRangeAttribute attribute,\\nconst void *devPtr,\\nsize_t count);\\n\\nThis function queries an attribute of the memory range starting at devPtrwith a size of count bytes.\\nThe memory rangemust refer to managedmemory allocated via cudaMallocManaged or declared via\\n__managed__ variables. It is possible to query the following attributes:\\n\\n▶ cudaMemRangeAttributeReadMostly: the result returned will be 1 if all pages in the given\\nmemory range have read-duplication enabled, or 0 otherwise.\\n\\n▶ cudaMemRangeAttributePreferredLocation: the result returned will be a GPU device id or\\ncudaCpuDeviceId if all pages in the memory range have the corresponding processor as their\\npreferred location, otherwise cudaInvalidDeviceId will be returned. An application can use\\nthis query API to make decision about staging data through CPU or GPU depending on the pre-\\nferred location attribute of the managed pointer. Note that the actual location of the pages in\\nthe memory range at the time of the query may be different from the preferred location.\\n\\n22.2. Unified memory on devices with full CUDA Unified Memory support 511\\n\\nindex.html#um-requirements\\n\\n\\nCUDA C++ Programming Guide, Release 12.4\\n\\n▶ cudaMemRangeAttributeAccessedBy: will return the list of devices that have that advise set\\nfor that memory range.\\n\\n▶ cudaMemRangeAttributeLastPrefetchLocation: will return the last location to which all\\npages in thememory rangewere prefetched explicitly using cudaMemPrefetchAsync. Note that\\nthis simply returns the last location that the application requested to prefetch thememory range\\nto. It gives no indication as to whether the prefetch operation to that location has completed or\\neven begun.\\n\\nAdditionally, multiple attributes can be queried by using corresponding cudaMemRangeGetAt-\\ntributes function.\\n\\nNote that on systems with pageable memory access, this currently only applies to managed memory,\\nbut not system-allocated memory.\\n\\n22.2.8.5 Overview of memory allocators for Unified Memory\\n\\nSince systems with pageable memory access contain hardware support for address translations be-\\ntween host and device, various different allocators may be used to allocate Unified Memory.

This is supported in CUDA and can be used to share memory between dif-\\nferent devices connected to the same host. However, this is currently not supported for sharing\\nmemory between multiple hosts as well as multiple devices. See Interprocess Communication\\n(IPC) with Unified Memory for details.\\n\\n▶ cudaHostAlloc and cudaMallocHost currently allocate memory pinned to the host (always\\nplaced in CPUmemory), accessible from both host and device, but which does not migrate to the\\ndevice. See also Page-Locked Host Memory for details on this type of memory. The same applies\\nto memory registered with CUDA through cudaHostRegister: currently, these memory ranges\\nwill not migrate to the device, but are accessible to both host and device.\\n\\n▶ On systems with Hardware Coherency (ATS) where devicememory is exposed as a NUMA domain\\nto the system, special allocators such as numa_alloc_on_nodemay be used to pin memory to\\nthe givenNUMAnode, either host or device. Thismemory is accessible fromboth host and device\\nand does not migrate. Similarly, mbind can be used to pin memory to the given NUMA node(s),\\nand can cause file-backed memory to be placed on the given NUMA node(s) before it is first\\naccessed.\\n\\n▶ For access to Unified Memory or other CUDAmemory through a network on multiple hosts, con-\\nsult the documentation of the communication library used, for example NCCL, NVSHMEM, Open-\\nMPI, UCX, etc.\\n\\n22.2.8.6 Atomic accesses\\n\\nIn general, atomic accesses can be performed by the CPU using std::atomic or std::atomic_ref\\nfrom the C++ standard library header <atomic>. When allocating std::atomic through a specialized\\nallocator such as cudaMallocManaged, one may call std::atomic_init to initialize the allocated\\nmemory.\\n\\nSimilarly, on the device, atomic accesses can be performed using cuda::atomic or\\ncuda::atomic_ref from the CUDA toolkit as defined in <cuda∕atomic>. When allocating\\ncuda::atomic through a specialized allocator such as cudaMallocManaged, to initialize the\\nallocated memory, you can call cuda::std::atomic_init or use cuda::atomic_ref.\\n\\nOn systemswith pageablememory access, since device threads can access system-allocatedmemory\\nlike any other type of memory, atomics can easily be shared between host and device threads, using\\ncuda::atomic*. Note that atomics of device threads using cuda::atomic* and host threads using\\nstd::atomic* or other variants such as GCC atomic builtins cannot be mixed. If most accesses are\\nmade by device threads, we recommend that the physical backing memory is placed on the device\\nmemory, see Data Usage Hints. Note that atomics at system-wide scope can be performed with the\\nC-style atomicAdd_system function as well, see Atomic Functions.\\n\\nOn systems without Hardware Coherency, atomic accesses from the device to file-backed host mem-\\nory are not supported. The following example code is valid on systems with Hardware Coherency but\\nundefined on other systems:\\n\\n22.2.

For such a direct\\naccess, both the GPU’s MMU and the CPU’s MMU need to coordinate to translate the address and\\nretrieve the requested data. Specifically, both MMUs contain TLBs to cache address translations. Fre-\\nquent accesses to a wide range of addresses can lead to TLB thrashing, which may severly decrease\\nperformance of the memory system. The following steps can be taken to identify and mitigate TLB\\ncache misses:\\n\\n1. Profilers such as NVIDIA Nsight Systems and Linux perf can be used to identify TLB misses for\\nthe CPU’s TLB.\\n\\n2. If an application has a high TLBmiss rate, a first step can be to try to reduce the workingmemory\\nsize of kernels accessing memory, increasing the effectiveness of TLBs.\\n\\n514 Chapter 22.

A second step can be to try to improve memory access patterns: this can be difficult for parallel\\nprograms running on the GPU, but access patterns such that all active threads request similar\\naddresses will increase the effectiveness of TLBs.\\n\\n4. A third step can be to increase the page size of the allocation tomatch the page size of the device,\\nsee Page Sizes for details. Managed memory currently always allocates the GPU-default page\\nsize. However, for system-allocated memory, the page size can be increased using transparent\\nhuge pages (THP), HugeTLB or the VMM APIs.\\n\\n22.2.8.7.1 Assessing the need for Huge Pages\\n\\nIn order to determine whether huge pages are necessary for performance improvements or not, it\\nis useful to be able to determine whether the application produces many TLB misses, see also the\\nsection on Page Sizes for details around page sizes and impact on TLB caches.\\n\\nDetermining TLB cache misses for the CPU is easy on Linux-based systems through perf stat, and\\nis a good proxy for whether the GPU experiences TLB misses for the same memory.\\n\\nTracking page fault events (faults), TLB load and miss events (dTLB-loads, dTLB-load-misses),\\nand LLC events (cache-misses, cache-references) cover enough information to help you decide\\nwhether you need huge pages. All trackable events can be listed using perf list.\\n\\nBelow is sample output from perf stat:\\n\\nperf stat -e \\'faults,dTLB-loads,dTLB-load-misses,cache-misses,cache-references\\'\\n↪→<EXECUTABLE> <ARGUMENTS>\\n\\nPerformance counter stats for \\'<EXECUTABLE> <ARGUMENTS>\\':\\n\\n70,080 faults:u\\n34,285,589 dTLB-loads:u\\n30,657,940 dTLB-load-misses:u # 89.42% of all dTLB cache hits\\n51,676,464 cache-misses:u # 44.81% of all cache refs\\n115,346,452 cache-references:u\\n...\\n\\nWhen you encounter significant TLB miss to LLC miss ratios on the CPU, we recommend that you\\nexplore the potential performance improvement by using huge pages.\\n\\n22.2.8.7.2 Enable Huge Pages through Transparent Huge Pages (THP)\\n\\nNote: On ARM-based systems, the defaut system page size is typically 16KiB or 64KiB, meaning that\\ndefault transparent huge page size may not match the GPU’s default page size. See Page Sizes for\\ndetails. In this case, it is recommended to enable huge pages through HugeTLB.\\n\\nIf the kernel parameter mm∕transparent_hugepage∕enabled to be set to always, THP is enabled\\nfor all standard allocators. If it is set to madvise, THP can be enabled for a specific range through the\\nmadvise function using the MADV_HUGEPAGE flag.\\n\\nAllocators such as glibc’s malloc may call madvise automatically, starting with glibc version 2.35\\nif the tunable glibc.malloc.hugetlb is set to 1, for example through the environment variable\\nGLIBC_TUNABLE=glibc.malloc.hugetlb=1. This means that if the kernel kernel parameter mm∕\\ntransparent_hugepage∕enabled is set to madvise, large enough allocations using glibc version\\n2.35+ may use huge pages automatically.\\n\\n22.2.

One way\\nto increase the likelihood of allocating huge pages is to set the top-pad to the huge-page size in\\nbytes. If the desired huge page size is 2MiB for example, one can use the environment variable MAL-\\nLOC_TOP_PAD_=2097152 or the tunables environment variable GLIBC_TUNABLE=glibc.malloc.\\nhugetlb=1:glibc.malloc.top_pad=2097152. These tunables apply to all libc-based allocation\\nfunctions, including calloc, posix_memalign, and others, see the libc Memory Allocation Tunables\\ndocumentation for further details. The following example shows how to manually increase likelihood\\nof allocating huge pages by using posix_memalign to obtain allocations aligned to the huge page\\nsize directly:\\n\\nvoid *ptr = nullptr;\\nsize_t nbytes = 1<<30; ∕∕ 1GiB;\\n∕∕ allocation usually backed by huge pages on systems with THP enabled\\nptr = malloc(nbytes);\\n...\\nvoid *ptr2 = nullptr;\\nsize_t huge_page_size = 1<<21; ∕∕ 2MiB;\\n∕∕ allocation with posix_memalign and madvise can help ensuring\\n∕∕ the allocated memory is actually backed by huge pages\\nposix_memalign(&ptr2, huge_page_size, nbytes);\\nmadvise(ptr2, nbytes, MADV_HUGEPAGE);\\n\\nRefer to the Linux kernel documentation on THP for more information about THP in general.\\n\\nNote that THP can be setup through shared memory files, too, but this requires\\n\\n22.2.8.7.3 Enable Huge Pages through HugeTLB\\n\\nLinux provides the HugeTLB mechanism to pre-allocate and obtain huge pages of any size through\\nhuge page pools. Usually, these pools must be setup at boot time through kernel boot parameters,\\nbut can be mounted as a file-system, too, see further below in this section.\\n\\nYou can allocate huge pages using mmap or shm_open ∕ shmget along with the right flags: the\\nallocated memory size must be perfectly divisible by the page size, and the MAP_HUGETLB flag has to\\nbe set.

On software coherent systems,\\nthis may introduce additional page faults, while on hardware coherent systems, it may cause higher\\nlatencies between CPU operations. Thus, in order to share data produced by the host with the device,\\nconsider writing to CPU-resident memory and reading the values directly from the device. The code\\nbelow shows how to achieve this with unified memory.\\n\\nSystem Allocator\\n\\nsize_t data_size = sizeof(int);\\nint* data = (int*)malloc(data_size);\\n∕∕ ensure that data stays local to the host and avoid faults\\ncudaMemAdvise(data, data_size, cudaMemAdviseSetPreferredLocation, cudaCpuDeviceId);\\ncudaMemAdvise(data, data_size, cudaMemAdviseSetAccessedBy, cudaCpuDeviceId);\\n\\n∕∕ frequent exchanges of small data: if the CPU writes to CPU-resident memory,\\n∕∕ and GPU directly accesses that data, we can avoid the CPU caches re-loading\\n∕∕ data if it was evicted in between writes\\nfor (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i) {\\n\\n*data = 42 + i;\\nkernel<<<1, 1>>>(data);\\ncudaDeviceSynchronize();\\n∕∕ CPU cache potentially evicted data here\\n\\n}\\nfree(data);\\n\\nManaged\\n\\nint* data;\\nsize_t data_size = sizeof(int);\\ncudaMallocManaged(&data, data_size);\\n∕∕ ensure that data stays local to the host and avoid faults\\ncudaMemAdvise(data, data_size, cudaMemAdviseSetPreferredLocation, cudaCpuDeviceId);\\ncudaMemAdvise(data, data_size, cudaMemAdviseSetAccessedBy, cudaCpuDeviceId);\\n\\n∕∕ frequent exchanges of small data: if the CPU writes to CPU-resident memory,\\n∕∕ and GPU directly accesses that data, we can avoid the CPU caches re-loading\\n∕∕ data if it was evicted in between writes\\nfor (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i) {\\n\\n*data = 42 + i;\\nkernel<<<1, 1>>>(data);\\ncudaDeviceSynchronize();\\n∕∕ CPU cache potentially evicted data here\\n\\n}\\ncudaFree(data);\\n\\n22.2.

For contiguous data, using the CUDA copy-engines\\nis preferred because operations performed by copy-engines can be overlapped with work on both the\\nhost and device. Copy-engines are used in all cudaMemcpy* and cudaMemPrefetchAsync APIs. For\\nthe same reason, option 1 is preferred over option 3 for large enough data: if both host and device\\nperformwork that does not saturate their respectivememory systems, the transfer can be performed\\nby the copy-engines concurrently with the work performed by both host and device.\\n\\nWe recommend to explicitly specify the direction of transferwithcudaMemcpy*, seememcpybehavior.\\n\\nCopy-engines are generally used for both transfers between host and device as well as between peer\\ndevices within an NVLink-connected system. Due to the limited total number of copy-engines, some\\nsystems may have a lower bandwidth of cudaMemcpy* compared to using the device to explicitly per-\\nform the transfer. In such a case, if the transfer is in the critical path of the application, it may be\\npreferred to use an explicit device-based transfer.\\n\\n22.2.8.10 Granularity of memory transfers\\n\\nOn software coherent systems, any access to unified memory may cause a page fault, see System\\nallocator.

Unified memory on devices with only CUDA\\nManaged Memory support\\n\\nFor devices with compute capability 6.x or higher but without pageable memory access, CUDA Man-\\naged Memory is fully supported and coherent. The programming model and performance tuning of\\nunified memory is largely similar to the model as described in Unified memory on devices with full\\nCUDA Unified Memory support, with the notable exception that system allocators cannot be used to\\nallocate memory. Thus, the following list of sub-sections do not apply:\\n\\n▶ System Allocator\\n\\n▶ Hardware Coherency\\n\\n▶ Atomic accesses\\n\\n▶ Enable Huge Pages through Transparent Huge Pages (THP)\\n\\n▶ Enable Huge Pages through HugeTLB\\n\\n▶ Avoid frequent writes to GPU-resident memory from the CPU\\n\\n▶ Exploiting asynchronous access to system memory\\n\\n22.3.2. Unified memory on Windows or devices with\\ncompute capability 5.x\\n\\nDevices with compute capability lower than 6.0 or Windows platforms support CUDA Managed Mem-\\nory v1.0 with limited support for data migration and coherency as well as memory oversubscription.\\nThe following sub-sections describe inmore detail how to use and optimizeManagedMemory on these\\nplatforms.\\n\\n22.3.2.1 Data Migration and Coherency\\n\\nGPU architectures of compute capability lower than 6.0 do not support fine-grained movement of the\\nmanaged data to GPU on-demand. Whenever a GPU kernel is launched all managed memory generally\\nhas to be transferred to GPU memory to avoid faulting on memory access. With compute capability\\n6.x a new GPU page faulting mechanism is introduced that provides more seamless Unified Memory\\nfunctionality. Combined with the system-wide virtual address space, page faulting provides several\\nbenefits. First, page faulting means that the CUDA system software doesn’t need to synchronize all\\nmanaged memory allocations to the GPU before each kernel launch. If a kernel running on the GPU\\naccesses a page that is not resident in its memory, it faults, allowing the page to be automatically mi-\\ngrated to the GPU memory on-demand. Alternatively, the page may be mapped into the GPU address\\nspace for access over the PCIe or NVLink interconnects (mapping on access can sometimes be faster\\nthan migration). Note that Unified Memory is system-wide: GPUs (and CPUs) can fault on andmigrate\\nmemory pages either from CPU memory or from the memory of other GPUs in the system.\\n\\n520 Chapter 22.

Managed memory\\nallocations behave similar to unmanaged memory allocated using cudaMalloc(): the current active\\ndevice is the home for the physical allocation but other GPUs in the system will access the memory at\\nreduced bandwidth over the PCIe bus.\\n\\nOn Linux the managed memory is allocated in GPU memory as long as all GPUs that are actively being\\nused by a program have the peer-to-peer support. If at any time the application starts using a GPU\\nthat doesn’t have peer-to-peer support with any of the other GPUs that have managed allocations on\\nthem, then the driver will migrate all managed allocations to system memory. In this case, all GPUs\\nexperience PCIe bandwidth restrictions.\\n\\nOnWindows, if peermappings are not available (for example, betweenGPUs of different architectures),\\nthen the system will automatically fall back to using zero-copy memory, regardless of whether both\\nGPUs are actually used by a program. If only one GPU is actually going to be used, it is necessary to\\nset the CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES environment variable before launching the program. This constrains\\nwhich GPUs are visible and allows managed memory to be allocated in GPU memory.\\n\\nAlternatively, on Windows users can also set CUDA_MANAGED_FORCE_DEVICE_ALLOC to a non-zero\\nvalue to force the driver to always use devicememory for physical storage. When this environment vari-\\nable is set to a non-zero value, all devices used in that process that support managed memory have to\\nbe peer-to-peer compatible with each other. The error ::cudaErrorInvalidDevicewill be returned\\nif a device that supportsmanagedmemory is used and it is not peer-to-peer compatiblewith any of the\\nother managed memory supporting devices that were previously used in that process, even if ::cud-\\naDeviceReset has been called on those devices. These environment variables are described in CUDA\\nEnvironment Variables. Note that starting fromCUDA 8.0 CUDA_MANAGED_FORCE_DEVICE_ALLOC has\\nno effect on Linux operating systems.\\n\\n22.3.2.4 Coherency and Concurrency\\n\\nSimultaneous access to managed memory on devices of compute capability lower than 6.0 is not pos-\\nsible, because coherence could not be guaranteed if the CPU accessed a Unified Memory allocation\\nwhile a GPU kernel was active.\\n\\n22.3.2.4.1 GPU Exclusive Access To Managed Memory\\n\\nTo ensure coherency on pre-6.x GPU architectures, the UnifiedMemory programmingmodel puts con-\\nstraints on data accesses while both the CPU and GPU are executing concurrently. In effect, the GPU\\nhas exclusive access to all managed datawhile any kernel operation is executing, regardless of whether\\nthe specific kernel is actively using the data. When managed data is used with cudaMemcpy*() or\\ncudaMemset*(), the system may choose to access the source or destination from the host or the\\ndevice, which will put constraints on concurrent CPU access to that data while the cudaMemcpy*() or\\ncudaMemset*() is executing. See Memcpy()/Memset() Behavior With Managed Memory for further\\ndetails.\\n\\n22.3.

(Note how it occurs\\nbefore cudaDeviceSynchronize().) The code runs successfully on devices of compute capability 6.x\\ndue to the GPU page faulting capability which lifts all restrictions on simultaneous access. However,\\nsuch memory access is invalid on pre-6.x architectures even though the CPU is accessing different\\ndata than the GPU. The program must explicitly synchronize with the GPU before accessing y:\\n\\n__device__ __managed__ int x, y=2;\\n__global__ void kernel() {\\n\\nx = 10;\\n}\\nint main() {\\n\\nkernel<<< 1, 1 >>>();\\ncudaDeviceSynchronize();\\ny = 20; ∕∕ Success on GPUs not supporing concurrent access\\nreturn 0;\\n\\n}\\n\\nAs this example shows, on systems with pre-6.x GPU architectures, a CPU thread may not access any\\nmanaged data in between performing a kernel launch and a subsequent synchronization call, regard-\\nless of whether the GPU kernel actually touches that same data (or anymanaged data at all). Themere\\npotential for concurrent CPU and GPU access is sufficient for a process-level exception to be raised.\\n\\nNote that if memory is dynamically allocatedwith cudaMallocManaged() or cuMemAllocManaged()\\nwhile the GPU is active, the behavior of the memory is unspecified until additional work is launched or\\nthe GPU is synchronized. Attempting to access the memory on the CPU during this time may or may\\nnot cause a segmentation fault. This does not apply to memory allocated using the flag cudaMemAt-\\ntachHost or CU_MEM_ATTACH_HOST.\\n\\n22.3.2.4.2 Explicit Synchronization and Logical GPU Activity\\n\\nNote that explicit synchronization is required even if kernel runs quickly and finishes before the CPU\\ntouches y in the above example. UnifiedMemory uses logical activity to determine whether the GPU is\\nidle. This aligns with the CUDA programming model, which specifies that a kernel can run at any time\\nfollowing a launch and is not guaranteed to have finished until the host issues a synchronization call.\\n\\nAny function call that logically guarantees the GPU completes its work is valid. This includes cudaDe-\\nviceSynchronize(); cudaStreamSynchronize() and cudaStreamQuery() (provided it returns\\ncudaSuccess and not cudaErrorNotReady) where the specified stream is the only stream still exe-\\ncuting on the GPU; cudaEventSynchronize() and cudaEventQuery() in cases where the specified\\n\\n522 Chapter 22. Unified Memory Programming\\n\\n\\n\\nCUDA C++ Programming Guide, Release 12.4\\n\\nevent is not followed by any device work; as well as uses of cudaMemcpy() and cudaMemset() that\\nare documented as being fully synchronous with respect to the host.\\n\\nDependencies created between streams will be followed to infer completion of other streams by syn-\\nchronizing on a stream or event. Dependencies can be created via cudaStreamWaitEvent() or im-\\nplicitly when using the default (NULL) stream.\\n\\nIt is legal for the CPU to accessmanaged data fromwithin a stream callback, provided no other stream\\nthat could potentially be accessing managed data is active on the GPU. In addition, a callback that is\\nnot followed by any device work can be used for synchronization: for example, by signaling a condition\\nvariable from inside the callback; otherwise, CPU access is valid only for the duration of the callback(s).\\n\\nThere are several important points of note:\\n\\n▶ It is always permitted for the CPU to access non-managed zero-copy data while the GPU is active.\\n\\n▶ The GPU is considered active when it is running any kernel, even if that kernel does not make use\\nof managed data. If a kernel might use data, then access is forbidden, unless device property\\nconcurrentManagedAccess is 1.\\n\\n▶ There are no constraints on concurrent inter-GPU access of managed memory, other than those\\nthat apply to multi-GPU access of non-managed memory.\\n\\n▶ There are no constraints on concurrent GPU kernels accessing managed data.\\n\\nNote how the last point allows for races betweenGPUkernels, as is currently the case for non-managed\\nGPU memory. As mentioned previously, managed memory functions identically to non-managed\\nmemory from the perspective of the GPU. The following code example illustrates these points:\\n\\nint main() {\\ncudaStream_t stream1, stream2;\\ncudaStreamCreate(&stream1);\\ncudaStreamCreate(&stream2);\\nint *non_managed, *managed, *also_managed;\\ncudaMallocHost(&non_managed, 4); ∕∕ Non-managed, CPU-accessible memory\\ncudaMallocManaged(&managed, 4);\\ncudaMallocManaged(&also_managed, 4);\\n∕∕ Point 1: CPU can access non-managed data.\\nkernel<<< 1, 1, 0, stream1 >>>(managed);\\n*non_managed = 1;\\n∕∕ Point 2: CPU cannot access any managed data while GPU is busy,\\n∕∕ unless concurrentManagedAccess = 1\\n∕∕ Note we have not yet synchronized, so \"kernel\" is still active.\\n*also_managed = 2; ∕∕ Will issue segmentation fault\\n∕∕ Point 3: Concurrent GPU kernels can access the same data.\\nkernel<<< 1, 1, 0, stream2 >>>(managed);\\n∕∕ Point 4: Multi-GPU concurrent access is also permitted.\\ncudaSetDevice(1);\\nkernel<<< 1, 1 >>>(managed);\\nreturn 0;\\n\\n}\\n\\n22.3. Unified memory on devices without full CUDA Unified Memory support 523\\n\\n\\n\\nCUDA C++ Programming Guide, Release 12.4\\n\\n22.3.2.4.3 Managing Data Visibility and Concurrent CPU + GPU Access with Streams\\n\\nUntil now it was assumed that for SM architectures before 6.x: 1) any active kernel may use any man-\\naged memory, and 2) it was invalid to use managed memory from the CPU while a kernel is active.\\nHere we present a system for finer-grained control of managed memory designed to work on all de-\\nvices supporting managed memory, including older architectures with concurrentManagedAccess\\nequal to 0.\\n\\nTheCUDAprogrammingmodel provides streams as amechanism for programs to indicate dependence\\nand independence among kernel launches. Kernels launched into the same stream are guaranteed to\\nexecute consecutively, while kernels launched into different streams are permitted to execute con-\\ncurrently. Streams describe independence between work items and hence allow potentially greater\\nefficiency through concurrency.\\n\\nUnifiedMemory builds upon the stream-independencemodel by allowing a CUDA program to explicitly\\nassociate managed allocations with a CUDA stream. In this way, the programmer indicates the use of\\ndata by kernels based on whether they are launched into a specified stream or not. This enables op-\\nportunities for concurrency based on program-specific data access patterns. The function to control\\nthis behavior is:\\n\\ncudaError_t cudaStreamAttachMemAsync(cudaStream_t stream,\\nvoid *ptr,\\nsize_t length=0,\\nunsigned int flags=0);\\n\\nThe cudaStreamAttachMemAsync() function associates length bytes ofmemory starting from ptr\\nwith the specified stream. (Currently, length must always be 0 to indicate that the entire region\\nshould be attached.) Because of this association, the Unified Memory system allows CPU access to\\nthis memory region so long as all operations in stream have completed, regardless of whether other\\nstreams are active. In effect, this constrains exclusive ownership of the managed memory region by\\nan active GPU to per-stream activity instead of whole-GPU activity.\\n\\nMost importantly, if an allocation is not associated with a specific stream, it is visible to all running\\nkernels regardless of their stream. This is the default visibility for a cudaMallocManaged() allocation\\nor a __managed__ variable; hence, the simple-case rule that the CPU may not touch the data while\\nany kernel is running.\\n\\nBy associating an allocation with a specific stream, the program makes a guarantee that only kernels\\nlaunched into that streamwill touch that data. No error checking is performed by the UnifiedMemory\\nsystem: it is the programmer’s responsibility to ensure that guarantee is honored.\\n\\nIn addition to allowing greater concurrency, the use of cudaStreamAttachMemAsync() can (and typ-\\nically does) enable data transfer optimizations within the Unified Memory system that may affect\\nlatencies and other overhead.\\n\\n22.3.2.4.4 Stream Association Examples\\n\\nAssociating data with a stream allows fine-grained control over CPU + GPU concurrency, but what data\\nis visible to which streams must be kept in mind when using devices of compute capability lower than\\n6.0. Looking at the earlier synchronization example:\\n\\n__device__ __managed__ int x, y=2;\\n__global__ void kernel() {\\n\\nx = 10;\\n}\\n\\n(continues on next page)\\n\\n524 Chapter 22.

Accesses to y by\\nthe GPU running kernel will now produce undefined results.\\n\\nNote that associating a variable with a stream does not change the associating of any other variable.\\nFor example, associating x with stream1 does not ensure that only x is accessed by kernels launched\\nin stream1, thus an error is caused by this code:\\n\\n__device__ __managed__ int x, y=2;\\n__global__ void kernel() {\\n\\nx = 10;\\n}\\nint main() {\\n\\ncudaStream_t stream1;\\ncudaStreamCreate(&stream1);\\ncudaStreamAttachMemAsync(stream1, &x);∕∕ Associate “x” with stream1.\\ncudaDeviceSynchronize(); ∕∕ Wait for “x” attachment to occur.\\nkernel<<< 1, 1, 0, stream1 >>>(); ∕∕ Note: Launches into stream1.\\ny = 20; ∕∕ ERROR: “y” is still associated globally\\n\\n∕∕ with all streams by default\\nreturn 0;\\n\\n}\\n\\nNote how the access to ywill cause an error because, even though x has been associatedwith a stream,\\nwe have told the system nothing about who can see y. The system therefore conservatively assumes\\nthat kernelmight access it and prevents the CPU from doing so.\\n\\n22.3.2.4.5 Stream Attach With Multithreaded Host Programs\\n\\nThe primary use for cudaStreamAttachMemAsync() is to enable independent task parallelism using\\nCPU threads. Typically in such a program, a CPU thread creates its own stream for all work that it\\ngenerates because using CUDA’s NULL stream would cause dependencies between threads.\\n\\nThe default global visibility of managed data to any GPU stream can make it difficult to avoid interac-\\ntions between CPU threads in a multi-threaded program. Function cudaStreamAttachMemAsync()\\nis therefore used to associate a thread’s managed allocations with that thread’s own stream, and the\\nassociation is typically not changed for the life of the thread.\\n\\nSuch a programwould simply add a single call to cudaStreamAttachMemAsync() to use unifiedmem-\\nory for its data accesses:\\n\\n∕∕ This function performs some task, in its own private stream.\\nvoid run_task(int *in, int *out, int length) {\\n\\n∕∕ Create a stream for us to use.\\n(continues on next page)\\n\\n22.3.

The result is much simpler code than occurs with explicitly\\ncopying data between host and device, although the result is the same.\\n\\n22.3.2.4.6 Advanced Topic: Modular Programs and Data Access Constraints\\n\\nIn the previous example cudaMallocManaged() specifies the cudaMemAttachHost flag, which cre-\\nates an allocation that is initially invisible to device-side execution. (The default allocation would be\\nvisible to all GPU kernels on all streams.) This ensures that there is no accidental interaction with an-\\nother thread’s execution in the interval between the data allocation and when the data is acquired for\\na specific stream.\\n\\nWithout this flag, a new allocation would be considered in-use on the GPU if a kernel launched by\\nanother thread happens to be running. This might impact the thread’s ability to access the newly\\nallocated data from the CPU (for example, within a base-class constructor) before it is able to explicitly\\nattach it to a private stream. To enable safe independence between threads, therefore, allocations\\nshould be made specifying this flag.\\n\\nNote: An alternative would be to place a process-wide barrier across all threads after the allocation\\nhas been attached to the stream. This would ensure that all threads complete their data/stream as-\\nsociations before any kernels are launched, avoiding the hazard. A second barrier would be needed\\nbefore the stream is destroyed because stream destruction causes allocations to revert to their de-\\nfault visibility. The cudaMemAttachHost flag exists both to simplify this process, and because it is not\\nalways possible to insert global barriers where required.\\n\\n526 Chapter 22.

On devices where concur-\\nrentManagedAccess is not set, the following rules apply:\\n\\nIf cudaMemcpyHostTo* is specified and the source data is unified memory, then it will be accessed\\nfrom the host if it is coherently accessible from the host in the copy stream (1); otherwise it will be ac-\\ncessed from the device. Similar rules apply to the destination when cudaMemcpy*ToHost is specified\\nand the destination is unified memory.\\n\\nIf cudaMemcpyDeviceTo* is specified and the source data is unified memory, then it will be accessed\\nfrom the device. The source must be coherently accessible from the device in the copy stream (2);\\notherwise, an error is returned. Similar rules apply to the destination when cudaMemcpy*ToDevice is\\nspecified and the destination is unified memory.\\n\\nIf cudaMemcpyDefault is specified, then unified memory will be accessed from the host either if it\\ncannot be coherently accessed from the device in the copy stream (2) or if the preferred location for\\nthe data is cudaCpuDeviceId and it can be coherently accessed from the host in the copy stream (1);\\notherwise, it will be accessed from the device.\\n\\nWhen using cudaMemset*() with unified memory, the data must be coherently accessible from the\\ndevice in the stream being used for the cudaMemset() operation (2); otherwise, an error is returned.\\n\\nWhen data is accessed from the device either by cudaMemcpy* or cudaMemset*, the stream of opera-\\ntion is considered to be active on the GPU. During this time, any CPU access of data that is associated\\nwith that stream or data that has global visibility, will result in a segmentation fault if the GPU has\\na zero value for the device attribute concurrentManagedAccess. The program must synchronize\\nappropriately to ensure the operation has completed before accessing any associated data from the\\nCPU.\\n\\n1.

Unified Memory Programming\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 23. Lazy Loading\\n\\n23.1. What is Lazy Loading?\\n\\nLazy Loading delays loading of CUDAmodules and kernels from program initalization closer to kernels\\nexecution. If a program does not use every single kernel it has included, then some kernels will be\\nloaded unneccesarily. This is very common, especially if you include any libraries. Most of the time,\\nprograms only use a small amount of kernels from libraries they include.\\n\\nThanks to Lazy Loading, programs are able to only load kernels they are actually going to use, saving\\ntime on initialization. This reduces memory overhead, both on GPU memory and host memory.\\n\\nLazy Loading is enabled by setting the CUDA_MODULE_LOADING environment variable to LAZY.\\n\\nFirstly, CUDA Runtime will no longer load all modules during program initialization, with the exception\\nof modules containing managed variables. Each module will be loaded on first usage of a variable or\\na kernel from that module. This optimization is only relevant to CUDA Runtime users, CUDA Driver\\nusers who use cuModuleLoad are unaffected. This optimization shipped in CUDA 11.8. The behavior\\nfor CUDA Driver users who use cuLibraryLoad to load module data into memory can be changed by\\nsetting the CUDA_MODULE_DATA_LOADING environment variable.\\n\\nSecondly, loading amodule (cuModuleLoad*() family of functions) will not be loading kernels immedi-\\nately, instead it will delay loading of a kernel until cuModuleGetFunction() is called. There are certain\\nexceptions here, some kernels have to be loaded during cuModuleLoad*(), such as kernels of which\\npointers are stored in global variables. This optimization is relevant to both CUDA Runtime and CUDA\\nDriver users. CUDA Runtime will only call cuModuleGetFunction()when a kernel is used/referenced\\nfor the first time. This optimization shipped in CUDA 11.7.\\n\\nBoth of these optimizations are designed to be invisible to the user, assuming CUDA Programming\\nModel is followed.\\n\\n23.2. Lazy Loading version support\\n\\nLazy Loading is a CUDA Runtime and CUDA Driver feature. Upgrades to both might be necessary to\\nutilize the feature.\\n\\n529\\n\\n\\n\\nCUDA C++ Programming Guide, Release 12.4\\n\\n23.2.1. Driver\\n\\nLazy Loading requires R515+ user-mode library, but it supports Forward Compatibility, meaning it can\\nrun on top of older kernel mode drivers.\\n\\nWithout R515+ user-mode library, Lazy Loading is not available in any shape or form, even if toolkit\\nversion is 11.7+.\\n\\n23.2.2. Toolkit\\n\\nLazy Loading was introduced in CUDA 11.7, and received a significant upgrade in CUDA 11.8.\\n\\nIf your application usesCUDARuntime, then in order to see benefits fromLazy Loading your application\\nmust use 11.7+ CUDA Runtime.\\n\\nAs CUDA Runtime is usually linked statically into programs and libraries, this means that you have to\\nrecompile your program with CUDA 11.7+ toolkit and use CUDA 11.7+ libraries.\\n\\nOtherwise you will not see the benefits of Lazy Loading, even if your driver version supports it.\\n\\nIf only some of your libraries are 11.7+, you will only see benefits of Lazy Loading in those libraries.\\nOther libraries will still load everything eagerly.\\n\\n23.2.3. Compiler\\n\\nLazy Loading does not require any compiler support. Both SASS and PTX compiled with pre-11.7 com-\\npilers can be loadedwith Lazy Loading enabled, andwill see full benefits of the feature. However, 11.7+\\nCUDA Runtime is still required, as described above.\\n\\n23.3. Triggering loading of kernels in lazy mode\\n\\nLoading kernels and variables happens automatically, without any need for explicit loading. Simply\\nlaunching a kernel or referencing a variable or a kernel will automatically load relevant modules and\\nkernels.\\n\\nHowever, if for any reason you wish to load a kernel without executing it or modifying it in any way, we\\nrecommend the following.\\n\\n23.3.1. CUDA Driver API\\n\\nLoading of kernels happens during cuModuleGetFunction() call. This call is necessary even without\\nLazy Loading, as it is the only way to obtain a kernel handle.\\n\\nHowever, you can also use this API to control with finer granularity when kernels are loaded.\\n\\n530 Chapter 23. Lazy Loading\\n\\n\\n\\nCUDA C++ Programming Guide, Release 12.4\\n\\n23.3.2. CUDA Runtime API\\n\\nCUDA Runtime APImanagesmodulemanagement automatically, so we recommend simply using cud-\\naFuncGetAttributes() to reference the kernel.\\n\\nThis will ensure that the kernel is loaded without changing the state.\\n\\n23.4. Querying whether Lazy Loading is turned\\non\\n\\nIn order to check whether user enabled Lazy Loading, CUresult cuModuleGetLoadingMode ( CU-\\nmoduleLoadingMode* mode ) can be used.\\n\\nIt’s important to note that CUDA must be initialized before running this function. Sample usage can\\nbe seen in the snippet below.\\n\\n#include \"cuda.h\"\\n#include \"assert.h\"\\n#include \"iostream\"\\n\\nint main() {\\nCUmoduleLoadingMode mode;\\n\\nassert(CUDA_SUCCESS == cuInit(0));\\nassert(CUDA_SUCCESS == cuModuleGetLoadingMode(&mode));\\n\\nstd::cout << \"CUDA Module Loading Mode is \" << ((mode == CU_MODULE_LAZY_\\n↪→LOADING) ? \"lazy\" : \"eager\") << std::endl;\\n\\nreturn 0;\\n}\\n\\n23.4. Querying whether Lazy Loading is turned on 531\\n\\n\\n\\nCUDA C++ Programming Guide, Release 12.4\\n\\n23.5. Possible issues when adopting lazy loading\\n\\nLazy Loading is designed so that it should not require any modifications to applications to use it. That\\nsaid, there are some caveats, especially when applications are not fully compliant with CUDA Program-\\nming Model.\\n\\n23.5.1. Concurrent execution\\n\\nLoading kernels might require context synchronization. Some programs incorrectly treat the possi-\\nbility of concurrent execution of kernels as a guarantee. In such cases, if program assumes that two\\nkernels will be able to execute concurrently, and one of the kernels will not return without the other\\nkernel executing, there is a possibility of a deadlock.\\n\\nIf kernel A will be spinning in an infinite loop until kernel B is executing. In such case launching kernel\\nB will trigger lazy loading of kernel B. If this loading will require context synchronization, then we have\\na deadlock: kernel A is waiting for kernel B, but loading kernel B is stuck waiting for kernel A to finish\\nto synchronize the context.\\n\\nSuch program is an anti-pattern, but if for any reason you want to keep it you can do the following:\\n\\n▶ preload all kernels that you hope to execute concurrently prior to launching them\\n\\n▶ run application with CUDA_MODULE_DATA_LOADING=EAGER to force loading data eagerly with-\\nout forcing each function to load eagerly\\n\\n23.5.2. Allocators\\n\\nLazy Loading delays loading code from initialization phase of the program closer to execution phase.\\nLoading code onto the GPU requires memory allocation.\\n\\nIf your application tries to allocate the entire VRAMon startup, e.g. to use it for its own allocator, then it\\nmight turn out that there will be no more memory left to load the kernels. This is despite the fact that\\noverall Lazy Loading frees up more memory for the user. CUDA will need to allocate some memory to\\nload each kernel, which usually happens at first launch time of each kernel. If your application allocator\\ngreedily allocated everything, CUDA will fail to allocate memory.\\n\\nPossible solutions:\\n\\n▶ use cudaMallocAsync() instead of an allocator that allocates the entire VRAM on startup\\n\\n▶ add some buffer to compensate for the delayed loading of kernels\\n\\n▶ preload all kernels that will be used in the program before trying to initialize your allocator\\n\\n532 Chapter 23. Lazy Loading\\n\\n\\n\\nCUDA C++ Programming Guide, Release 12.4\\n\\n23.5.3. Autotuning\\n\\nSome applications launch several kernels implementing the same functionality to determinewhich one\\nis the fastest. While it is overall advisable to run at least one warmup iteration, it becomes especially\\nimportant with Lazy Loading. After all, including time taken to load the kernel will skew your results.\\n\\nPossible solutions:\\n\\n▶ do at least one warmup interaction prior to measurement\\n\\n▶ preload the benchmarked kernel prior to launching it\\n\\n23.5.
